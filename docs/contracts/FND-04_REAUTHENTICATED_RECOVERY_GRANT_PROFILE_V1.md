# FND-04 Reauthenticated Recovery Grant Security / Interchange Profile v1

- Status: Candidate normative cross-repository security profile; canonical when the owning FND-04 delivery merges
- Profile ID: `oteryn-reauth-recovery-v1`
- Applies to: Platform-reauthenticated attempts to recover control of an already-existing authoritative CharacterId actor/GameSession state
- Does not apply to: fresh actor admission, OAuth/web session, Game Login Ticket, fast reconnect-secret proof, Channel/Instance handoff or Canary admission
- Cryptographic container: JWS Compact Serialization carrying a JWT claims set
- Signature profile: fully specified JOSE `alg = Ed25519`
- Standards baseline: RFC 7515, RFC 7519, RFC 8032, RFC 8037, RFC 8725 and RFC 9864
- Does not select: implementation library, KMS/HSM/vendor, recovery-locator transport, persistence/cache schema or deployment

## 1. Purpose and authority

This profile exists so loss of the game-domain reconnect secret does not force a fresh-entry credential to be misused as a recovery credential.

It proves only:

```text
Platform freshly authenticated AccountId
AND Platform currently permits AccountId to attempt recovery of CharacterId
```

It does not prove GameSession existence, reconnectability, current actor placement, CharacterLease/runtime ownership or permission to move/respawn/recreate the actor. Oteryn-v2 resolves those facts.

## 2. Mutually exclusive profile

Fresh entry:

```text
typ     = oteryn-admission+jwt
profile = oteryn-pre-admission-v1
purpose = fresh_entry
aud     = urn:oteryn:game:admission
```

Reauthenticated recovery:

```text
typ     = oteryn-recovery+jwt
profile = oteryn-reauth-recovery-v1
purpose = existing_actor_recovery
aud     = urn:oteryn:game:recovery
```

Validators are mutually exclusive. Failure under one profile never triggers reinterpretation as the other.

A fresh-entry Channel-bound grant cannot move an existing actor. Recovery intentionally contains no ChannelId/InstanceId authority.

## 3. Exact cryptographic/header profile

Recovery v1 uses JWS Compact JWT with only the fully specified JOSE `alg = Ed25519` from RFC 9864.

The protected header MUST contain exactly:

```json
{
  "alg": "Ed25519",
  "kid": "<trusted-recovery-key-id>",
  "typ": "oteryn-recovery+jwt"
}
```

Rules:

- only `alg = Ed25519`;
- deprecated polymorphic `alg = EdDSA` is rejected;
- `kid` is 1..64 ASCII matching `[A-Za-z0-9._-]+` and selects only from the trusted recovery-key set;
- reject `none`, other algorithms/curves and algorithm fallback;
- reject `jku`, `x5u`, `x5c`, embedded `jwk`, `crit`, `cty`, `zip`, `b64=false` and all extra header members;
- never fetch verification keys from token-supplied URIs.

If trusted key distribution uses JWK, the public key follows the JOSE OKP/Ed25519 representation; the token `alg` remains `Ed25519`.

Recovery key purpose is distinct from fresh-entry, OAuth, Game Login Ticket and service-authentication purposes.

## 4. Issuer and audience

```text
iss = urn:oteryn:platform:game-recovery
aud = urn:oteryn:game:recovery
```

Exact case-sensitive matching is mandatory.

## 5. Required claims

Unknown/unregistered claims are rejected in v1.

### Standard claims

| Claim | Type | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `iss` | string | exact Section 4 issuer |
| `aud` | string | exact single Section 4 audience; arrays rejected |
| `iat` | integer JSON number | whole-second NumericDate, authoritative Platform time |
| `nbf` | integer JSON number | `iat - 1 <= nbf <= iat + 1` |
| `exp` | integer JSON number | `exp > iat`, `exp - iat <= 30` seconds |
| `jti` | string | RecoveryGrantNonce: 32 random bytes, base64url unpadded, exactly 43 chars |

### Oteryn claims

| Claim | Type | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `profile` | string | exact `oteryn-reauth-recovery-v1` |
| `purpose` | string | exact `existing_actor_recovery` |
| `attempt_ref` | string | Platform recovery-attempt correlation reference; canonical lowercase RFC UUIDv7 text |
| `account_id` | string | canonical lowercase non-nil UUID in the authoritative Platform representation accepted by FND-ID-01 |
| `character_id` | string | canonical lowercase non-nil RFC UUIDv7 text |
| `world_id` | string | canonical lowercase non-nil RFC UUIDv7 text |
| `account_security_generation` | string | decimal non-zero uint64 string |
| `protocol_major` | integer JSON number | exact `1` |
| `compatibility_revision` | string | bounded ASCII 1..64, `[A-Za-z0-9._:-]+` |

All UUID claims MUST parse and round-trip to the exact canonical lowercase hyphenated form. Nil UUID is rejected.

`attempt_ref`, `character_id` and `world_id` additionally MUST encode UUID version `7` and the RFC UUID variant; a syntactically canonical UUIDv1/v4/v6, Microsoft-reserved variant or other non-v7/non-RFC value is rejected. `account_id` remains Platform-owned and is validated against the authoritative Platform representation accepted by FND-ID-01 rather than being silently redefined as an Oteryn-issued UUIDv7.

This profile MUST NOT contain `channel_id`, `instance_id`, NodeId, runtime owner identity or scope ownership generation as placement authority. Oteryn-v2 resolves current actor/session placement after credential validation.

## 6. Parser and time ceilings

- compact token <= 4096 ASCII bytes;
- exactly 3 JWS segments;
- decoded header <= 512 bytes;
- decoded payload <= 3072 bytes;
- JSON nesting depth <= 2;
- duplicate JSON members reject;
- invalid UTF-8/non-canonical base64url/padding reject;
- fractional/exponent NumericDate reject;
- required null/missing claim reject;
- no decompression;
- maximum lifetime 30 seconds;
- maximum verifier clock skew 5 seconds.

A producer may issue a shorter lifetime.

## 7. Platform security freshness

Recovery is higher-risk than ordinary reconnect-secret proof because fresh Platform authentication substitutes for missing game-domain proof.

Required Platform-security evidence age:

```text
<= 5 seconds
```

If evidence is stale/unavailable/unauthenticated/contradictory, recovery fails closed.

Reject if account is disabled/revoked or token `account_security_generation` is below current minimum-valid generation.

Platform may require MFA/step-up/risk checks before issuing this profile. That policy does not transfer final game authority to Platform.

## 8. RecoveryGrantNonce and producer attempt

`jti` is the one-time RecoveryGrantNonce, distinct from `attempt_ref`.

- game consume state keyed by trusted issuer/profile/jti;
- at most one successful recovery authority transition per jti;
- concurrent use has at most one winner;
- consumed jti stays consumed after lost response;
- replay evidence retained at least through `exp + 5 seconds` and longer when DUR/reconciliation requires.

`attempt_ref` is producer idempotency/correlation only. Ambiguous producer retry for the same logical attempt cannot mint multiple independently usable recovery grants.

## 9. Current game-domain recovery resolution

After cryptographic/security validation, the game resolves state by AccountId + CharacterId + WorldId.

The grant can authorize only one of two game-domain transitions.

### 9.1 Same-GameSession recovery

Require:

- existing session in accepted unexpected-loss `RECONNECTABLE` state;
- still inside same-session 15-second grace;
- no healthy current controller;
- current AccountId->CharacterId ownership;
- AccountPresenceClaim still same CharacterId;
- current CharacterLease/runtime authority;
- current game-domain placement;
- safe FND-02 command/session reconciliation state.

Success preserves GameSessionId and uses the FND-04 reconnect PREPARE/COMMIT state machine; this recovery grant substitutes only for the missing current reconnect-secret authentication proof.

PREPARE is not authorization escrow. If this grant is used to create a prepared rebind, COMMIT MUST atomically revalidate before any authority change that:

- the prepared transition is unexpired and still belongs to the current GameSession/current predecessor generation;
- the recovery JWT is still inside its accepted time window and its one-time nonce remains eligible;
- current trusted Platform-security evidence is fresh and still admits the grant's `account_security_generation`;
- the account/character ownership, AccountPresenceClaim, CharacterLease, runtime ownership/placement and reconciliation state are still current;
- no healthy current controller has regained sufficient current-generation authority;
- the same-session grace remains valid.

If any condition changed, COMMIT fails before fencing the predecessor, the prepared candidate is cancelled/terminalized, its successor secret never becomes current proof and no connection generation advances. A caller must reconcile current authority and, when required, obtain a fresh recovery grant; possession of a prepared successor secret never overrides changed authorization.

### 9.2 Post-grace existing-actor attachment

Require:

- prior GameSession terminal;
- same authoritative actor still `PRESENT_UNCONTROLLED`;
- no current playable controller;
- AccountPresenceClaim remains same CharacterId;
- current AccountId->CharacterId ownership;
- current CharacterLease/runtime actor;
- current placement resolved by game-domain authority.

Success creates a **new GameSessionId**, new connection_generation namespace beginning at `1`, new reconnect proof and control attachment to the existing actor without respawn/reset/teleport/heal.

If neither state exists, reject. The recovery grant never silently becomes fresh-entry authority.

## 10. Healthy incumbent safety

A valid recovery JWT, a reconnect secret, a prepared successor secret or a completed PREPARE alone cannot preempt a healthy current controller.

Healthy combat/PZ/logout-locked incumbent remains authoritative. Intentional logout-eligible takeover uses the separate takeover state machine, not an unconditional recovery-grant/reconnect-secret fence. Any future healthy-session migration requires a separately current-generation-authorized transition and is not implied by this profile.

## 11. Current-placement routing

The client/Gateway does not choose actor placement from stale route memory.

Implementation must provide a bounded authenticated game-domain recovery locator/dispatcher that:

- resolves current actor/session owner and scope ownership generation;
- routes/proxies to the current owner without exposing unnecessary private topology;
- fails closed on ambiguous/suspected/unavailable current ownership;
- never treats Platform configured route as proof of actor placement.

Exact API/transport/deployment remains later design.

## 12. Re-entry protection

Consuming a recovery grant never creates protection by itself.

Protection remains keyed to one server-owned ControlLossEpoch:

- same-session or post-grace first eligible re-entry may consume that epoch's one protection activation;
- healthy/routine takeover does not;
- new JWT, new GameSessionId or new connection_generation cannot restart/duplicate consumed protection.

## 13. Verification order

1. outer protocol/material bound;
2. compact/parser limits;
3. exact protected-header profile;
4. trusted recovery-key lookup + Ed25519 verification;
5. exact typ/iss/aud/profile/purpose;
6. time/lifetime/skew;
7. claim canonical encoding, including UUID version/variant requirements;
8. current Platform-security evidence;
9. one-time RecoveryGrantNonce eligibility;
10. current AccountId->CharacterId ownership;
11. current actor/session/presence/lease/runtime placement;
12. healthy-controller/reconnectable/post-grace decision;
13. atomic game-domain recovery/rebind/new-session commit, including the COMMIT-time revalidation required by Section 9.1 for a prepared same-session rebind;
14. publish success only after commit.

No failure creates partial player-control authority.

## 14. Independent fixtures / fault cases

Before implementation acceptance prove:

- canonical `alg=Ed25519` recovery JWT across independent producer/consumer implementations;
- deprecated `alg=EdDSA` rejection;
- fresh-entry token rejected by recovery validator and vice versa;
- wrong key purpose/alg/typ/issuer/audience/purpose/profile;
- forbidden/extra header and unknown claim;
- lifetime/skew/stale Platform-security rejection;
- canonical-looking wrong UUID version and wrong UUID variant rejection for `attempt_ref`, `character_id` and `world_id`;
- concurrent one-time jti consume;
- healthy incumbent cannot be preempted;
- PREPARE followed by incumbent liveness recovery cannot COMMIT/fence that incumbent;
- PREPARE followed by recovery-grant expiry/revocation/security-generation change cannot COMMIT;
- PREPARE followed by lease/runtime/session/reconciliation change cannot COMMIT under stale prepared authority;
- same-session recovery preserves GameSessionId and advances connection generation only after successful revalidation/COMMIT;
- post-grace recovery creates fresh GameSessionId without actor reset;
- stale Platform/client ChannelId does not move actor;
- InstanceRuntime actor is resolved through current game-domain placement;
- unreconstructable same-session state after GameNode replacement falls back safely rather than guessing continuity;
- consumed grant/lost response cannot create a second controller or duplicate protection.

## 15. Non-authorization

This profile does not implement or authorize Platform recovery issuer, recovery locator, Rust session runtime, database/cache schema, protocol message registration, key deployment or production traffic.
