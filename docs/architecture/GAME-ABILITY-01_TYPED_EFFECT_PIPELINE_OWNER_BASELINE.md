# GAME-ABILITY-01 — Typed Effect Pipeline Owner Baseline

- Status: **OWNER-ACCEPTED PARTIAL BASELINE / GAME-ABILITY-01 REMAINS OPEN**
- Date: 2026-08-13
- Gate: `GAME-ABILITY-01`
- Scope: ability-definition and effect-resolution authority model only
- Runtime/client/protocol/DDL/Platform/production authority: **NONE**

## Decision

Oteryn abilities use a **data-first semantic definition + typed effect pipeline + bounded Wasm/WIT extension** model.

```text
Ability Definition
-> Ability Invocation
-> targeting / legality / cost checks
-> typed Effect Plan
-> authoritative validation
-> authoritative commit
-> typed Result / domain events
```

An Ability Definition is versioned content/ruleset data under DUR-04. It is not unrestricted executable code with direct write authority.

An Effect Plan is a bounded typed proposal of candidate consequences. Producing a plan does not mutate authoritative state. Only the authoritative simulation/domain owner may validate and commit accepted effects.

## Decision timing

**Must decide now: YES.** Targeting, legality, cast/interruption, cost, cooldown, condition and Reference-parity decisions need one common execution/authority model first.

This prevents later content work from creating two competing mutation engines: typed domain mechanics and script-driven direct state mutation.

It unblocks paper-only design of target resolution, legality, timing, costs, cooldowns/charges, conditions, effect-family composition, parity fixtures and Oteryn Studio authoring.

## Semantic boundaries

### Ability Definition

A semantic content/ruleset definition may later describe targeting, timing, costs, prerequisites, cooldowns/charges, effect composition, condition intent, presentation references and an optional bounded extension hook.

This baseline does **not** select a physical file format, serializer or Rust representation.

### Ability Invocation

The client requests intent. The authoritative server resolves legality, current targets, costs and results. This document creates no competing foundation identity; invocation/CommandRef identity remains with existing FND/SIM contracts and later GAME-ABILITY work.

### Effect Plan

An Effect Plan contains typed candidate consequences. Damage, healing, resource changes, condition proposals, dispel, movement, summon/spawn and item-related proposals are illustrative examples only; the exhaustive effect vocabulary is not frozen here.

### Authoritative commit

Commit must preserve applicable accepted contracts, including FND-03 one-writer/order/generation authority, FND-04 fencing, GAME-ITEM/DUR-03 conservation and idempotency, SIM-DETERMINISM exact arithmetic/RNG/order/revision semantics, DUR-04 script determinism/resource limits and ANL-01 event/audit boundaries.

Ability content cannot bypass those contracts.

## Data-first, not data-only

Most abilities should use validated declarative composition over typed mechanic/effect primitives because this improves static validation, deterministic testing, parity fixtures, runtime efficiency, editor tooling, migration analysis and Game Intelligence observability.

Oteryn still keeps a bounded Wasm/WIT extension path for mechanics that would otherwise require excessive primitive proliferation.

## Wasm/WIT extension boundary

Ability extensions consume only capability-bounded, snapshot-bound inputs exposed by DUR-04 and return bounded typed proposals.

They may not directly mutate Character, Item, World, Channel or Instance state; bypass persistence, ownership/session fences, DUR-03 conservation or SIM determinism; or return untyped authoritative state patches.

Extension failure, resource exhaustion, invalid proposals or revision mismatch must fail under an explicit later policy and never fall back to direct mutation or a different ruleset interpretation.

## Determinism and revision binding

Authoritative ability resolution must remain reproducible under SIM-DETERMINISM. Later implementation binds every behavior-affecting revision required for replay, including as applicable exact ability/content revision, ruleset/profile revision, numeric/formula profile, script profile/artifact, RNG evidence and normalized authoritative inputs/order.

A delayed, retried or resumed logical occurrence may not silently switch to a newer incompatible ability definition or formula revision.

## Deliberately not decided

This partial baseline does not decide target grammar/LoS, legality error precedence, cast/channel/interruption, cost reservation/consumption timing, cooldown/charge semantics, condition stacking/refresh/dispel/ticks, exhaustive effect families, combat formulas, Reference ability catalogue/parity, physical authoring format, exact WIT/Wasmtime implementation, protocol layout, client UI or persistence layout.

## Supersession criteria

Reopen only with concrete evidence that representative mechanics cannot be expressed without unsafe complexity or excessive primitive proliferation, measured overhead prevents accepted performance goals, replay/migration/security evidence favors a safer boundary, or Oteryn Studio authoring evidence shows the model is impractical.

Any supersession must explicitly preserve or replace the authority, determinism, conservation and bounded-extension safety properties accepted here.
