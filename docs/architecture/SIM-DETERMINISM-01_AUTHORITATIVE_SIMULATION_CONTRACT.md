# SIM-DETERMINISM-01 — Authoritative Simulation Determinism Contract

- Status: `PROPOSED / IN_REVIEW / NOT_STARTED`
- Date: 2026-08-13
- Gate: `SIM-DETERMINISM-01`
- Scope: paper-only architecture contract.
- Runtime/combat/AI/script implementation authority: **NONE**.
- PostgreSQL DDL/migration authority: **NONE**.
- Production authority: **NONE**.

## 1. Purpose

This contract defines deterministic execution semantics required before broad authoritative combat, AI, progression and formula implementation.

It refines FND-03 runtime ordering/RNG/replay requirements and composes with DUR-04 script determinism. It MUST NOT replace FND-03 authority/order, DUR-03 exact value conservation or ruleset/content ownership of actual gameplay formulas.

## 2. Core reproducibility invariant

For one semantic runtime scope:

```text
same canonical authoritative starting state
+ same ownership-generation/order evidence
+ same ordered normalized authoritative inputs
+ same exact semantic revision set bound to those inputs
+ same SimulationDeterminismProfileRevision
+ same applicable script artifact/WIT/execution profiles
+ same normalized external authoritative facts
=> same normalized authoritative state/result sequence
```

Thread IDs, CPU count, worker placement, OS scheduling, socket wake-up timing and non-semantic wall-clock jitter MUST NOT be replay prerequisites.

## 3. FND-03 authority remains binding

`RuntimeExecutionOrdinal` remains owner-local to `(semantic scope, ownership generation)` and remains the authoritative runtime input-linearization evidence.

SIM MUST NOT create a second runtime commit counter or global total order.

FND-02 CommandRef/order, domain revisions, EventId, OperationId and TransactionId remain distinct identities.

## 4. Simulation determinism profile

Every authoritative simulation execution MUST bind one immutable/versioned:

```text
SimulationDeterminismProfileRevision
```

The profile MUST identify cross-cutting deterministic semantics that can alter normalized authoritative outcome, including:

- numeric semantic-class policy;
- checked overflow/invalid-number defaults;
- rounding vocabulary/semantics;
- authoritative gameplay RNG algorithm/profile identity and stream-derivation version;
- RNG decision/consumption semantics;
- SIM-owned tie-break/canonical-order profiles;
- canonical state-hash serialization/profile;
- supported authoritative-target policy;
- compatibility with applicable DUR-04 `script_execution_profile_revision`.

An implementation MUST NOT change those semantics under an unchanged profile revision.

The SIM profile MUST NOT replace `ruleset_revision`, `content_revision`, `world_policy_revision` or DUR-04 script execution profile identity.

## 5. Semantic revision binding

Every accepted authoritative occurrence that can outlive immediate synchronous resolution or be retried MUST bind the exact behavior-affecting semantic revision set needed to reproduce it, including as applicable:

- ruleset/formula revision;
- content revision;
- world-policy revision;
- `SimulationDeterminismProfileRevision`;
- script artifact/WIT/`script_execution_profile_revision`.

A physical retry, reconnect, failover or delayed completion MUST NOT silently re-evaluate the same logical occurrence under a newer incompatible revision merely because activation advanced in the meantime.

The owning domain MUST either:

1. complete/replay the occurrence under its originally bound compatible semantics; or
2. fail/reconcile through an explicit version-transition policy.

It MUST NOT simply reroll/recalculate the same occurrence under the new revision.

## 6. Numeric semantic classes

Every authoritative numeric field/formula MUST declare a semantic class.

### 6.1 Exact discrete

Identifiers, counts, ordinals, quantities and intrinsically discrete values MUST use exact checked integer semantics. Implicit overflow wrapping is forbidden.

### 6.2 Exact conservation/value

DUR-03 item/currency/value conservation quantities MUST remain exact. Binary floating point and tolerance comparison MUST NOT be authoritative conservation arithmetic.

### 6.3 Formula exact/fixed-scale

Rates, coefficients, percentages and formula intermediates SHOULD use explicit integer/fixed-scale/rational semantics where accepted behavior allows it. No one global scale is required; scale/denominator is formula/profile-owned.

### 6.4 Deterministic floating

Authoritative binary floating point MAY be used only when explicitly declared by the owning formula/profile and cross-target evidence proves identical normalized authoritative outcome.

The profile MUST define finite-input rules, NaN/infinity handling, conversion/serialization, rounding/canonicalization and relevant SIMD/floating feature policy.

Platform-dependent NaN payloads, reassociation-sensitive parallel reductions or tolerance-only branches MUST NOT decide authoritative gameplay.

### 6.5 Non-authoritative approximate

Renderer/UI/telemetry/analytics MAY use approximate floating values where they cannot feed back into authoritative gameplay. Re-entry into authority requires validated conversion to an authoritative semantic class.

## 7. Formula semantics descriptor

Every authoritative formula family affecting combat, progression, item modifiers, eligibility or other gameplay state MUST have a versioned descriptor/equivalent defining at least:

- formula/ruleset/content revision identity;
- input units/classes/ranges;
- internal numeric class;
- operation/order constraints where reassociation changes output;
- explicit rounding points and named modes;
- conversion/clamp/min/max behavior;
- overflow/underflow/divide-by-zero/invalid-value disposition;
- output unit/class/range;
- deterministic edge fixtures;
- Reference evidence status when claiming Reference behavior.

An unchanged formula/ruleset/SIM revision MUST NOT silently change arithmetic semantics.

## 8. Rounding and invalid numeric state

Rounding MUST occur only at explicit semantic boundaries declared by the formula profile. Rounding modes MUST be named/versioned rather than inherited from language/library defaults.

Unless an explicitly accepted formula says otherwise:

- integer overflow/underflow MUST fail before partial authoritative mutation;
- division by zero MUST fail deterministically;
- NaN/infinity in authoritative state MUST fail validation;
- out-of-range conversion MUST fail rather than wrap/truncate;
- impossible postconditions MUST trigger fail-closed invariant handling.

Debug/release or supported-target build mode MUST NOT change the result/disposition.

No rounding rule is assumed to match the Reference target without evidence.

## 9. Randomness classes

The implementation MUST separate:

- cryptographic/security randomness — nondeterministic, security-owned;
- authoritative gameplay randomness — deterministic/replayable under SIM;
- presentation randomness — non-authoritative.

Gameplay RNG MUST NOT generate credentials/secrets. A process-global mutable gameplay RNG stream is forbidden.

## 10. RNG semantic ownership and seed protection

Every authoritative random decision MUST belong to a named semantic scope/domain and stable purpose identity.

RNG identity MUST NOT depend on NodeId, OS thread, worker identity, pointer address, source-code line number or unordered-container position.

Changing process placement MUST NOT reseed gameplay semantics.

Server-controlled gameplay seed/root state MAY be deterministic and durable/replayable while still being security-sensitive. For exploit-sensitive decisions, seed/derivation MUST NOT be based only on public client-known values unless the owning product/security contract explicitly accepts predictability.

If secrecy is required to prevent loot/spawn/combat prediction, seed/root/substream evidence MUST be access-controlled and MUST NOT be exposed to clients or ordinary telemetry. Replay retention of such evidence follows security/privacy policy.

## 11. Purpose isolation

Unrelated mechanics MUST NOT share accidental draw-order coupling.

Every random decision MUST have a stable purpose/effect path equivalent to a versioned `RngPurposeKey`/semantic purpose identity.

An added unrelated draw in one purpose MUST NOT silently perturb another purpose's future authoritative sequence.

The implementation MAY satisfy this through:

- keyed/counter-style decisions using stable decision identity + draw index; or
- isolated stateful substreams with explicit authoritative checkpoint/replay state.

The chosen RNG algorithm/profile/parameters/stream derivation MUST be immutable under the active SIM profile and proven by cross-target fixtures before implementation acceptance.

## 12. Retry-stable random decisions

The same idempotently retried logical authoritative occurrence MUST NOT receive a new random outcome merely because physical execution was retried, runtime ownership moved or a newer content/ruleset/SIM revision became active.

Random decision identity MUST derive from stable owning semantic identity such as CommandRef, OperationId/TransactionId, stable timer/event occurrence identity or another accepted parent occurrence plus stable purpose path.

The random decision MUST use the semantic revision set bound under section 5 for that logical occurrence.

Transient RuntimeExecutionOrdinal/generation MAY be retained as order evidence but MUST NOT alone force a new random result for the same retry-safe semantic occurrence.

## 13. Stateful RNG advancement

When a stateful RNG/substream is used, stream advancement is authoritative state.

Therefore:

- work rejected before authoritative acceptance consumes no gameplay RNG;
- speculative workers consume no owner RNG state;
- abort/retry cannot advance one logical occurrence twice;
- if the owning resolution aborts before authoritative commit, tentative RNG advancement MUST NOT survive independently;
- committed advancement is checkpoint/replay state;
- draw count/order is deterministic for the purpose stream.

## 14. Script RNG composition

DUR-04 remains authoritative for guest execution behavior under `script_execution_profile_revision`.

SIM owns how an authoritative script invocation receives stable semantic random-decision/seed identity and how its proposal enters core FND-03 execution order.

Scripts MUST NOT receive a mutable core/process-global RNG handle. Script rejection/retry MUST NOT perturb unrelated core RNG sequences.

A retried script-backed logical occurrence MUST remain bound to the same compatible SIM/content/ruleset/script semantic revision set or use an explicit transition/reconciliation policy.

## 15. Time semantics

The implementation MUST preserve:

```text
wall clock != monotonic elapsed time != authoritative execution order
```

No universal fixed global tick is required.

An authoritative formula consuming time MUST receive an explicit normalized semantic time value with declared unit/precision/counting semantics. Direct system-clock reads are forbidden as hidden formula inputs.

Replay MUST use recorded/injected normalized time/calendar facts, never the replayer's current clock.

## 16. Simultaneous/conflicting input policy

For semantically simultaneous inputs, the owning domain MUST define one of:

1. commutative/set semantics making order irrelevant;
2. stable deterministic tie-break key;
3. FND-03 accepted RuntimeExecutionOrdinal order retained in replay evidence.

Pointer order, hash-map iteration, OS thread order and worker wake-up timing are forbidden tie-breakers.

## 17. Cross-session/cross-source order

SIM does not promise that independent live network/service arrivals occur in the same order on separate runs.

Determinism begins after normalization and FND-03 owner acceptance.

When chosen cross-source order affects gameplay, replay evidence MUST retain that accepted order.

## 18. Worker/service results

Auxiliary work results MUST enter as new normalized FND-03 inputs with generation/revision/input evidence sufficient for stale-result rejection.

If concurrently eligible results can produce different gameplay outcomes, the owning domain MUST use a stable comparator or retain the accepted FND-03 order for replay.

Worker wake-up order MUST NOT be gameplay authority.

A delayed result whose bound semantic revision is no longer compatible MUST fail/reconcile explicitly rather than being reinterpreted by current code/config.

## 19. External nondeterminism

Any external fact affecting authoritative gameplay MUST be normalized into a typed authoritative input/fact before use.

Replay MUST retain the accepted behavior-affecting value, identity and revision needed to reconstruct behavior, subject to privacy/security rules.

Runtime replay MUST NOT requery mutable external systems to rediscover historical gameplay facts.

Collections returned by an external source MUST be canonicalized to a defined semantic order before authority or have the exact accepted order retained as replay evidence where order is itself meaningful.

Secrets/reusable credentials/security randomness MUST NOT be stored merely to satisfy replay.

## 20. Replay envelope

A deterministic replay interval MUST identify at least:

- semantic runtime scope;
- relevant ownership-generation boundary;
- initial canonical state/checkpoint reference + hash;
- ordered normalized inputs and RuntimeExecutionOrdinal evidence;
- applicable CommandRef/OperationId/TransactionId/timer/event/work identities;
- the exact semantic revision set bound to each long-lived/retryable occurrence where it differs from the interval default;
- content/ruleset/world-policy revisions;
- active `SimulationDeterminismProfileRevision`;
- applicable formula profile revisions;
- applicable script artifact/WIT/`script_execution_profile_revision`;
- RNG root/substream/decision evidence required by the selected model;
- normalized logical-time/calendar/external facts;
- relevant state-domain revisions;
- expected canonical state/result hashes at selected cuts.

Replay MUST NOT require original thread IDs, CPU count, NodeId placement or wall-clock scheduling jitter.

## 21. Replay is not authority

Replay/testing/investigation is read-only evidence reconstruction.

A replay result MUST NOT directly mutate live gameplay, repair durable state, reissue historical commands as trusted live authority or bypass DUR/ANL correction mechanisms.

## 22. Canonical state hashing

Determinism tooling MUST support versioned canonical semantic state hashing independent of memory layout, padding, addresses, unordered collection iteration and non-authoritative cache/presentation state.

Hashing SHOULD be hierarchical:

```text
scope cut
 -> domain hashes
 -> aggregate/entity/component hashes
```

Concrete hash algorithm/canonicalization belongs to the SIM profile implementation artifact and MUST NOT silently change under one profile revision.

State hashes are evidence, not gameplay authority.

## 23. Hash cadence and divergence evidence

This contract does not require production hashing after every input.

Test/replay profiles MAY hash every ordinal; production/soak MAY hash checkpoint/domain cuts; incident tooling MAY increase detail on demand.

A deterministic comparison MUST be able to identify at least:

- first mismatching RuntimeExecutionOrdinal/checkpoint cut;
- normalized input identity/type;
- active semantic revision/profile set;
- first mismatching domain/component semantic hash path;
- relevant RNG decision/stream evidence;
- formula descriptor/rounding boundary;
- script artifact/execution profile when applicable.

Cadence, retention and storage remain bounded QA/ANL/PERF choices. Divergence evidence MUST NOT autonomously repair state.

## 24. Supported authoritative targets

For the same replay envelope, every supported authoritative server target MUST produce the same normalized authoritative outcome.

Exact discrete/conservation/fixed-scale outputs, RNG decisions and canonical state hashes MUST match exactly.

Authoritative floating implementations are acceptable only if cross-target fixtures prove the same normalized authoritative result.

A target unable to satisfy the current SIM profile MUST fail compatibility/readiness rather than silently diverge.

Client prediction/rendering is non-authoritative and need not match every server intermediate bit pattern; reconciliation remains the trust boundary.

## 25. Formula/ruleset compatibility

Formula/ruleset content MUST declare compatibility with required SIM profile capabilities/revisions.

Activation MUST fail closed if:

- required numeric/rounding/RNG semantics are unavailable;
- implementation semantics changed without a compatible new profile;
- claimed Reference behavior is still `UNKNOWN/CONFLICT` for the exercised path;
- required cross-target deterministic evidence is missing.

A newer SIM profile MUST NOT silently reinterpret old replay/content/ruleset revisions or pending retryable occurrences bound to older compatible semantics.

## 26. Failure semantics

On numeric/RNG/determinism invariant failure:

- no partial authoritative mutation may be committed where the owning resolution can fail/abort;
- unexpected invariant failure follows FND-03 fail-closed handling;
- DUR transactions retain their own commit/rollback semantics;
- no implicit clamp/wrap/reseed/reroll is invented;
- diagnostics identify input/profile/formula scope without exposing secrets.

Process recovery MUST NOT reseed gameplay randomness from current wall clock/entropy merely because NodeId/ownership generation changed.

## 27. Resource bounds

Before implementation acceptance, Resource Limits Registry/equivalent owning limits MUST cover applicable replay/state-hash/RNG/formula resources, including replay input/bytes, checkpoint/replay bytes, RNG purpose/substream state, authored formula expression/depth/operations where applicable, state-hash work/bytes, divergence evidence and deterministic replay/test work budget.

Missing required limits block implementation; they do not mean unlimited.

## 28. Security/privacy

Gameplay RNG seed/root/substream state MUST NOT be exposed to clients where prediction enables abuse.

A deterministic scheme that is trivially derivable from public identifiers/timestamps is unacceptable for exploit-sensitive decisions unless an explicit product/security contract chooses public predictability.

Replay/divergence artifacts are potentially sensitive player/world/security evidence and MUST use ANL/privacy access/retention/export controls.

Determinism MUST NOT require retention of reusable credentials, secret keys or raw security RNG.

## 29. Architecture decision timing

The numeric/RNG/order/replay semantic boundary MUST be accepted before broad combat/AI/progression formula implementation.

Concrete Rust libraries, exact gameplay RNG algorithm, per-formula fixed scale, formula values, global tick rate, scheduler implementation, worker counts, replay storage backend and production hash cadence are deliberately deferred.

A later explicit contract may supersede a SIM rule only with named evidence such as Reference behavior, cross-target divergence, replay/fault evidence, representative deterministic-profile performance evidence, security findings or changed product requirements.

## 30. Required implementation evidence

A future implementation MUST prove at least:

1. same replay envelope yields identical canonical final state/result hashes across supported authoritative server targets;
2. exact arithmetic overflow/divide-by-zero/out-of-range fixtures fail identically across build modes/targets;
3. each formula's named rounding points/modes match fixtures;
4. changing an unrelated RNG purpose draw does not perturb another purpose's sequence;
5. retry/failover of the same logical occurrence preserves its random decision and originally bound compatible semantic revision set;
6. activation of a newer revision while an occurrence is pending cannot silently cause that occurrence to be recalculated under new semantics;
7. rejected/speculative work does not advance owner RNG state;
8. stateful stream advancement aborts with a failed resolution and survives committed checkpoint/recovery exactly once;
9. process restart does not wall-clock-reseed gameplay RNG;
10. exploit-sensitive RNG cannot be reconstructed from public-only inputs under the selected seed/derivation policy unless predictability is explicitly accepted;
11. equal-deadline/simultaneous deterministic tie-break fixtures are stable where defined;
12. recorded cross-source order replays concurrency-sensitive result under different test thread scheduling;
13. stale worker/service results are rejected and cannot reorder authority;
14. replay uses captured/canonicalized external facts rather than current mutable external-system responses;
15. hierarchical hashes localize a seeded divergence to the first mismatching domain/component cut;
16. authoritative floating fixture, where allowed, normalizes identically across supported targets;
17. incompatible SIM/formula/script execution profile activation fails closed;
18. script proposal replay with the same bound semantic revision set produces the same normalized accepted/rejected result;
19. replay tooling cannot mutate live authority;
20. required replay/hash/RNG/formula limits have explicit boundary tests.

## 31. Non-authority statements

Acceptance of SIM-DETERMINISM-01 does NOT authorize Rust simulation implementation, RNG/numeric/hash dependency adoption, combat/AI/progression/script implementation, exact Reference/gameplay/balance formulas, protocol changes, PostgreSQL DDL/migrations, Platform writes, live/production replay correction or production deployment/configuration.

## 32. Lifecycle rule

This document remains a candidate while its delivery PR is open.

`SIM-DETERMINISM-01` may become `ACCEPTED / LIFECYCLE_CLOSED / NOT_STARTED` only after reviewed delivery merge plus a separate lifecycle closeout that reconciles maintained programme status/register/horizon/index/handoff and archives/releases the active task.
