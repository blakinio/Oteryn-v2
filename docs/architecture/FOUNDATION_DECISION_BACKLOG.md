# Oteryn v2 Foundation Decision Backlog

- Status: Active architecture backlog
- Date: 2026-08-05
- Coordination ID: `OTV2-NATIVE-FOUNDATION`
- Canonical programme task: `docs/agents/tasks/active/OTV2-20260805-foundation-preimplementation-contracts.md`
- Global decision register: `docs/architecture/GLOBAL_ARCHITECTURE_DECISION_REGISTER.md`
- Coordinator prompt: `docs/agents/prompts/OTV2_GLOBAL_ARCHITECTURE_DECISION_COORDINATOR.md`

## Purpose

Record the remaining architecture decisions in one durable, ordered register. This file distinguishes decisions that block root-workspace bootstrap, decisions that gate specific implementation layers, decisions required before durable gameplay, and subjects deliberately deferred.

The complete later project horizon is maintained in `GLOBAL_ARCHITECTURE_DECISION_REGISTER.md`. That register preserves gameplay, client, content, operations and product domains without forcing them to be designed before they block the current stage.

Chat history is not authoritative. Accepted ADRs, this backlog, the global register, the active programme task and live PR/CI state are the continuation sources.

## Stable gate identifiers

Use these identifiers in tasks, PRs, prompts and cross-repository coordination. Section numbers or stage letters are presentation only and must not replace the stable ID.

## Already accepted

The following are no longer open questions:

1. **Native target stack**
   - authoritative game server in Rust;
   - native game client in Rust;
   - one project-owned gameplay protocol: `protocol-oteryn`.

2. **Repository ownership and migration order**
   - the existing Rust client will move from `blakinio/otclient/oteryn-client` into `blakinio/Oteryn-v2`;
   - client, server, shared Rust types and `protocol-oteryn` will have one canonical repository and workspace;
   - `blakinio/otclient` remains migration/history evidence after the move;
   - `protocol-canary` is not part of the target runtime;
   - `FND-01` audits and classifies the exact source workspace;
   - `VSL-02` and the controlled client migration/cutover follow immediately after `FND-01`, before `FND-ID-01`, `FND-02`, `FND-03` or `FND-04` freeze shared contracts;
   - the destination must not create a competing placeholder client before the accepted migration/cutover;
   - one atomic `blakinio/Oteryn-v2` destination PR must include the accepted client import, root-workspace creation/completion, FND-01 dispositions, dependency enforcement, `protocol-canary` isolation, provenance and exact-head validation;
   - a later `blakinio/otclient` PR is source-only cutover closeout that marks the old path moved/non-canonical after the destination merge.

3. **Identity and Game Gateway boundary**
   - Platform Identity remains the reusable-credential, OAuth/PKCE, MFA and account-security authority;
   - Oteryn v2 does not introduce a second classic login server or password/OAuth authority;
   - Game Gateway remains in `blakinio/Oteryn-Platform`;
   - the initial Game Gateway remains implemented in Go;
   - the Rust game server accepts the bounded Game Session admission contract and owns gameplay admission and runtime state.

4. **Database direction**
   - PostgreSQL is the target relational database technology;
   - Platform and game use separate logical databases, owners, runtime credentials and migration histories;
   - the initial physical cluster may be shared, but `oteryn_platform` and `oteryn_game` remain separate security and ownership boundaries;
   - Redis is non-authoritative.

5. **Multichannel foundation**
   - one logical world may expose multiple gameplay channels;
   - one logical mutation owner exists per channel;
   - character persistence and selected world services are shared across channels;
   - channel-local simulation state is isolated;
   - one character has at most one active authoritative session and durable writes require generation fencing.

6. **Native world, content and editor direction**
   - Oteryn defines a project-owned world/content format from zero rather than using or extending OTBM as its canonical model;
   - the editable World Project, canonical world/content model and deterministic runtime World Bundle are separate representations;
   - OTBM, OTB, appearances, sprites and legacy XML are bounded conversion inputs, with constrained export only where semantics permit;
   - one integrated Oteryn Studio edits maps, areas, assets, sprites/appearances, items and related content through one Content Registry;
   - stable namespaced content keys are canonical; legacy and compact runtime numeric IDs are mappings;
   - logical `Area`/`Subarea` geography is independent of technical `Region`/`Chunk` partitioning;
   - dynamic encounters use validated `EncounterZone`, `RaidCell` and `RaidAnchor` scopes rather than treating an oversized subarea as the execution boundary;
   - authored static world definitions remain separate from authoritative dynamic PostgreSQL state;
   - Remere's Map Editor and Beats Assets Editor are reference/migration tools, not target runtime dependencies or automatically reusable code bases.

7. **Game Intelligence, analytics and audit direction**
   - Oteryn Game Intelligence is a first-class subsystem rather than a late dashboard add-on;
   - operational observability, best-effort gameplay telemetry and durable economy/security audit are distinct data classes;
   - gameplay/balance, world/content, economy/item integrity and security analytics are separate consumers of one versioned event foundation;
   - item/currency/security evidence is emitted atomically with authoritative transactions through an accepted outbox/audit boundary;
   - anti-duplication prevention remains authoritative in `DUR-03`; analytics supplies independent evidence and investigation;
   - AI and investigation remain read-only, external to gameplay and unable to ban, mutate, roll back or deploy autonomously;
   - privacy requires pseudonymous analytics identity, role-separated access and explicit retention, not name-only suppression.

8. **Native E2E platform direction**
   - one shared manifest-driven E2E platform owns lifecycle, evidence, timeouts and cleanup;
   - Tier 1 headless system E2E is the broad deterministic mechanism for Platform/Gateway/protocol/server/PostgreSQL coverage;
   - Tier 2 instrumented native-client E2E proves real client networking, input, reconciliation, UI and rendering without bypassing server authority;
   - Tier 3 production-binary smoke E2E proves exact release-candidate artifacts without the in-process test adapter;
   - hidden retry-until-green is forbidden and every counted physical attempt remains visible;
   - exact revisions, deterministic controls, first-divergence evidence and cleanup certification are mandatory;
   - `QA-E2E-01` blocks completion of `VSL-01`, but does not block `FND-01`, `VSL-02` or architecture discovery.

9. **Legacy protocol migration disposition**
   - `protocol-canary` is fixed as `REFERENCE_ONLY` migration evidence;
   - it is excluded from the production workspace dependency graph, binaries, negotiation, fallback and translation paths;
   - `protocol-oteryn` remains an independently designed native protocol.

10. **GameNode execution, capacity, deployment and recovery direction**
   - `GameNode` is the logical runtime identity of one game-server process identified by `NodeId`, distinct from the host, container and orchestrator node;
   - production defaults to one GameNode process per container, while one GameNode may host several ChannelRuntimes when measured capacity and blast-radius policy allow it;
   - the process is multithreaded, but each channel retains one logical authoritative writer and stale auxiliary results are rejected by identity, generation and revision;
   - capacity is measured separately per channel, GameNode and logical world; no fixed player limits are accepted without representative benchmarks;
   - the initial production headroom target is at least 30% below measured saturation until `PERF-01` provides superseding evidence;
   - existing GameNodes may start channels within accepted capacity, while an external orchestrator starts, replaces and stops processes or containers;
   - initial failure recovery uses fencing, checkpoint plus bounded replay, fresh Game Sessions and a full snapshot, without silently moving players to another channel.

Canonical decisions: ADR-0001 through ADR-0009.

## Progressive implementation policy

Architecture contracts remain mandatory for public and durable behavior, but compile-time and prototype evidence are part of architecture discovery.

### Gate 0 — before `FND-01`

- Do not create the canonical root Cargo workspace.
- Documentation, repository discovery and read-only technical research are allowed.
- A disposable experiment may exist only outside the canonical product paths or on a clearly bounded spike branch, with no compatibility, production-readiness or source-of-truth claim.

### Gate 1 — after `FND-01`

`VSL-02` becomes the next mandatory gate. It must pin the exact cutover source revision, reconcile open pull requests and post-inventory changes, define provenance/history preservation, destination path mapping, source freeze, rollback and the exact migration/bootstrapping sequence.

Allowed before `VSL-02` and its coordinated migration programme complete:

- documentation and architecture work;
- read-only verification of source and destination repository state;
- bounded migration-mechanism experiments outside canonical product paths;
- correction of the source inventory when the pinned source changes.

Not allowed before the controlled migration/cutover:

- a competing placeholder client in `blakinio/Oteryn-v2`;
- canonical client/server identifier, protocol, runtime or admission contracts frozen against a destination that lacks the canonical client;
- claiming the destination root workspace is the complete canonical Rust product workspace;
- treating the `FND-01` source inventory as current after unreviewed source changes.

The destination migration package must deliver one atomic `blakinio/Oteryn-v2` PR that imports the accepted client paths, applies every `FND-01` disposition, creates or completes the canonical root workspace, enforces the accepted dependency boundaries, isolates `protocol-canary`, records provenance and validates the complete destination head. No separate import-only or post-import workspace-consolidation destination PR is allowed. Every member still requires an immediate consumer and observable acceptance.

After that destination PR is squash-merged and verified, a separate coordinated `blakinio/otclient` source-marker PR marks the old path moved/non-canonical and points to the exact destination merge. It is closeout, not a second destination implementation phase.

### Gate 2 — after the atomic `VSL-02` destination merge and source-marker cutover

The canonical root workspace already exists around the migrated client. Later packages may extend it only for immediate consumers and within the accepted dependency graph.

Allowed:

- maintenance of the accepted root Cargo metadata, toolchain and lockfile;
- addition of minimal placeholder-free crates/applications required by an authorized immediate consumer;
- compile-only interfaces and test fixtures that do not silently freeze an unresolved public contract;
- dependency-graph checks and forbidden-edge validation;
- bounded, reversible technical spikes whose results are recorded as evidence.

Not yet allowed unless its own gate has passed:

- production `protocol-oteryn` wire compatibility claims;
- authoritative channel/runtime behavior;
- live Game Session admission or character lease behavior;
- durable authoritative gameplay mutation;
- broad content import.

### Gate 3 — layer-specific implementation

- `FND-ID-01` gates freezing identifier representations in protocol, Game Session and admission contracts.
- `FND-02` gates canonical protocol schemas/codecs, production framing and compatibility claims.
- `FND-03` gates authoritative runtime scheduling, ordering, lifecycle and recovery behavior.
- `FND-04` gates production admission, Game Session validation and character lease behavior.
- `PERF-01` gates published player-capacity claims and representative-load readiness.
- `OPS-CHANNEL-01` gates automatic production channel scaling and claimed production GameNode/channel recovery behavior.
- `DUR-01` through `DUR-03` gate authoritative durable character, item and currency mutation.
- `DUR-04` gates broad content import and durable scripting behavior.
- `QA-E2E-01` gates the shared three-tier E2E implementation and named evidence required for `VSL-01` completion.
- `VSL-01` gates the claim that the first native gameplay slice is complete.
- `ANL-01` gates final transactional event/outbox/audit boundaries used by `DUR-02` and `DUR-03`.
- `ANL-02` and `ANL-03` gate production-grade balance/world and economy/security analytics claims.
- `ANL-04` gates read-only AI investigation and is not required for the foundation vertical slice.

A spike is never a substitute for an accepted contract. It must be reversible, isolated from public contracts, excluded from production defaults and either removed or deliberately promoted by a later accepted task.

## Foundation contracts

### `FND-01` — Workspace, Dependency and Existing-Rust Migration Contract

This contract blocks creation of a competing destination workspace and is the mandatory migration audit for the existing Rust implementation in `blakinio/otclient/oteryn-client`. It must not design a duplicate workspace in isolation.

Decide:

- exact minimal initial workspace members and crate/application names;
- an exact source-SHA inventory of existing Rust crates, public contracts, consumers, tests and dependency edges;
- one migration disposition per existing crate or subsystem: `MIGRATE_AS_IS`, `MIGRATE_AND_RENAME`, `MERGE`, `SPLIT`, `REWRITE`, `REFERENCE_ONLY` or `DROP`;
- legal dependency directions and forbidden edges;
- ownership of shared identifiers, domain contracts, protocol schemas and test fixtures;
- feature policy and dependency review rules;
- target Rust edition, resolver, pinned toolchain, `rust-version`, root lockfile and `--locked` policy;
- inheritance policy for workspace package metadata, dependencies and lints;
- initial CI targets and exact target triples, at minimum Linux server and Windows client;
- a product-realistic feature/target matrix; `--all-features` is supplemental evidence and must not be the sole proof;
- whether optional client-only and server-only dependencies are isolated cleanly;
- a retained machine-readable `workspace-boundaries.toml` contract and executable `cargo metadata --locked` checks that enforce the accepted dependency graph;
- canonical ownership and required locations for the cross-repository contract lock, resource-limit registry, error vocabulary and failure-scenario catalogue;
- criteria for adding, splitting or merging crates later;
- which destination members must exist during migration and which must wait for immediate consumers.

The following is a **capability horizon**, not an accepted initial workspace and not a checklist to create empty crates:

```text
apps/client
apps/oteryn-studio
services/game-server
crates/foundation
crates/domain-core
crates/protocol-core
crates/protocol-oteryn
crates/transport
crates/simulation-core
crates/world-runtime
crates/world-schema
crates/world-project
crates/world-bundle
crates/world-compiler
crates/session-lease
crates/persistence-core
crates/persistence-postgres
crates/platform-contracts
crates/platform-client
crates/content-types
crates/content-registry
crates/content-runtime
crates/scripting
crates/test-support
```

An initial member requires an immediate named consumer and observable acceptance. Empty layering crates, speculative abstractions and convenience cycles are prohibited.

Mandatory direction: domain and simulation crates do not depend on Tokio, TCP, TLS, HTTP, SQL, PostgreSQL, Platform APIs, renderer state or UI widgets. World/content schema crates do not depend on Tauri, editor UI or renderer implementation. These boundaries must become machine-checked after the destination workspace exists.

`FND-01` completion does not authorize an isolated destination bootstrap. Its next gate is `VSL-02`.

### `VSL-02` — Exact Rust Client Migration and Cutover Contract

Accept immediately after `FND-01` and before `FND-ID-01`, `FND-02`, `FND-03` or `FND-04`.

Decide:

- exact cutover source SHA from `blakinio/otclient/oteryn-client`;
- reconciliation of every open PR, active task and source change after the `FND-01` inventory;
- provenance/history traceability compatible with mandatory squash merge: immutable source retention, exact SHA/range, machine-readable path/provenance mapping, copyright/license records and source links without false ancestry claims;
- exact source-to-destination path mapping and exclusions;
- migration disposition for every crate/subsystem using the `FND-01` classification;
- one atomic destination PR containing the accepted import, root-workspace creation/completion, dependency enforcement, `protocol-canary` isolation and complete validation;
- destination build/test matrix and source/destination equivalence evidence;
- isolation or removal of `protocol-canary` from the target runtime graph;
- source development freeze, moved/non-canonical marker and post-cutover ownership;
- cutover order across repositories;
- rollback conditions and procedure.

The migration programme requires one atomic destination task/branch/PR in `blakinio/Oteryn-v2`. A later separate task/branch/PR in `blakinio/otclient` may only freeze and mark the source moved/non-canonical after the verified destination merge. Both use one coordination ID and explicit rollout/rollback order. Do not freeze shared client/server contracts until both the destination is canonical and the source cutover marker is terminal.

### `FND-ID-01` — Foundation Identifier Vocabulary

Accept this minimum vocabulary after successful `VSL-02` migration/cutover and destination workspace bootstrap/completion, before `FND-02` or `FND-04` freezes wire/session schemas. Decide only the semantics required across process and repository boundaries:

- meaning, canonical owner and scope of `AccountId`, `CharacterId`, `WorldId`, `ChannelId`, `InstanceId`, `NodeId`, `GameSessionId`, `CommandId`, `EntityId`, `EventId`, `OperationId`, `TransactionId`, `CorrelationId`, `CausationId`, `AnalyticsActorId`, `ProtocolRevision`, `RulesetRevision`, `ContentRevision` and `SessionGeneration`;
- global versus scoped uniqueness and whether reuse is permitted;
- durable versus runtime-only identity;
- public/client-visible versus opaque identity;
- canonical comparison, textual diagnostics and wire/Game Session encoding constraints;
- compatibility and migration rules when an external producer uses a different storage representation.

Do not freeze PostgreSQL column types, indexes, full item-instance identity or every durable entity here. Those remain in `DUR-01`; the purpose of `FND-ID-01` is to prevent protocol and admission contracts from inventing incompatible meanings first.

### `FND-02` — `protocol-oteryn` v1 Contract

Decide:

- whether the exact latest merged Platform native contract is adopted, revised or explicitly superseded for the Rust server target; mutable PR heads are evidence only and cannot be canonical;
- the machine-readable `docs/contracts/CROSS_REPOSITORY_CONTRACT_LOCK.json` entry with merged commit, schema revision/hash, producer/consumer status and rollout order;
- initial transport;
- TLS model, certificate/key ownership and ALPN;
- frame header, endianness, message namespace and hard size limits;
- stable schema/IDL and canonical schema owner;
- protocol revision versus ruleset/content revision;
- capability negotiation and downgrade prevention;
- sequencing, acknowledgement and error vocabulary;
- `command_id`, replay protection and idempotency;
- snapshot, delta and reconciliation contracts;
- reconnect/resume semantics;
- compression rules and bounded allocation;
- entries in the resource-limit registry for every externally controlled size/depth/count;
- stable machine error categories and mapping into the foundation error vocabulary;
- golden fixtures shared by client and server.

Do not create a second silent native protocol beside the existing Platform contract. Rust memory layout or unstable serializer output cannot be the public wire contract.

### `FND-03` — Runtime Execution Contract

Decide:

- `NodeRuntime`, `WorldServices`, `ChannelRuntime` and `InstanceRuntime` responsibilities;
- modular-monolith initial deployment topology;
- fixed or variable tick model and initial tick frequency;
- monotonic versus wall-clock ownership, clock-skew tolerance, tick-to-time conversion and injected deterministic test clocks;
- authoritative command ordering;
- timer and scheduler semantics;
- bounded inbound/outbound/work queues;
- overload and backpressure behaviour;
- parallel pathfinding, AI and content work and safe return to the logical writer;
- deterministic replay requirements, including replay into read-only analytics/test consumers without replaying gameplay effects;
- versioned event emission, bounded gameplay-telemetry queues and fail-open/fail-closed behavior by durability class;
- channel lifecycle: starting, ready, full, draining, unhealthy, recovering and stopped;
- checkpoint and crash-recovery boundary;
- required outcomes for the named foundation failure scenarios covering overload, stale generations, dependency loss, split ownership and recovery.

### `FND-04` — Identity, Game Session, Admission and Character Lease Contract

The ownership boundary is accepted; the exact mechanism is not. This contract consumes the accepted `FND-ID-01` meanings and may not redefine them.

Decide:

- Game Session token format: signed, opaque or hybrid;
- issuer, audience and key ownership;
- key discovery, rotation and emergency revocation;
- issue, expiry and reconnect windows;
- atomic consume or equivalent replay prevention;
- capacity routing and channel binding;
- exact admission error vocabulary;
- `session_generation` allocation and fencing;
- lease owner and storage;
- lease acquisition, renewal, grace, expiry and release timings;
- duplicate login handling;
- safe channel switching;
- network partition and dependency failure behaviour;
- stable public/internal error mapping, correlation/redaction rules and expected results for the shared foundation failure-scenario catalogue.

Minimum data to evaluate:

```text
account_id
character_id
world_id
channel_id
game_session_id
session_generation
protocol_revision
ruleset_revision
content_revision
issued_at
expires_at
issuer
audience
```

## Capacity and channel operations follow-up contracts

ADR-0009 accepts the execution, capacity-measurement, deployment-boundary and recovery direction without inventing unsupported numerical limits or selecting an orchestrator product.

### `PERF-01` — Capacity, Performance and Scalability Contract

Decide and prove:

- named reference hardware, operating system and process/container resource cells;
- command, simulation, queue-age and resource service objectives;
- representative idle, movement, hunting, crowded-interest-set, mass-combat, raid, reconnect-storm, persistence-pressure, multi-channel noisy-neighbor and recovery workloads;
- separate channel, GameNode and logical-world capacity limits;
- safety headroom, overload admission and graceful-degradation policy;
- profiling, soak, memory-growth and performance-regression evidence;
- CI, nightly and release placement for repeatable benchmark evidence.

Player count alone is not a scaling signal. Accepted limits must also account for latency, queue age, CPU, memory, network, persistence health and the first violated service objective.

### `OPS-CHANNEL-01` — GameNode Deployment and Dynamic Channel Orchestration Contract

Decide:

- exact process/container packaging and production control-plane topology;
- GameNode registration, health, readiness, capacity and compatible-revision reporting;
- channel lifecycle, placement, dynamic creation, hysteresis, draining and closure;
- external orchestrator authority and least-privilege boundaries;
- ownership generation, fencing, restart, replacement, checkpoint, bounded replay and reconnect sequencing;
- reconnect grace, player-visible outcomes, RPO, RTO and disaster-test requirements;
- blast-radius limits and recovery-concurrency policy for several channels on one GameNode;
- rollout and rollback behavior without active-channel live migration in the initial implementation.

`FND-03`, `FND-04`, `DUR-02`, `DUR-03` and `QA-E2E-01` retain ownership of their execution, admission, persistence, anti-duplication and physical failure-evidence boundaries.

## Decisions required before durable gameplay mutation

### `DUR-01` — Durable Identifier Representation Contract

Freeze representations and visibility for:

- `AccountId`;
- `CharacterId`;
- `WorldId`;
- `ChannelId`;
- `InstanceId`;
- `NodeId`;
- `GameSessionId`;
- `CommandId`;
- `EntityId`;
- `ItemInstanceId`;
- `ProtocolRevision`;
- `ContentRevision`;
- `RulesetRevision`;
- `SessionGeneration`;
- `EventId`;
- `OperationId`;
- `TransactionId`;
- `CorrelationId`;
- `CausationId`;
- `AnalyticsActorId`.

Decide UUID/UUIDv7/integer usage, global versus scoped uniqueness, wire encoding, database encoding, public visibility and entity-ID reuse rules.

### `DUR-02` — Persistence v1 Contract

PostgreSQL is selected. Still decide:

- Rust migration mechanism and schema ownership;
- character state model and revision fencing;
- character lease schema and ownership;
- inventory/equipment and ground-item transfer transaction boundaries;
- idempotency keys and duplicate-command handling;
- isolation levels, locking and retry policy;
- transactional outbox boundaries, publication checkpoints, deduplication and recovery;
- critical append-only audit/journal scope and its separation from best-effort gameplay telemetry;
- atomic production of item/currency/security evidence with the owning authoritative transaction;
- checkpoint interval and maximum accepted progress loss;
- market, guild, house and reward consistency classes;
- partitioning where justified;
- backup, point-in-time recovery, restore tests, RPO and RTO;
- compatible migration rollout and rollback.

The default direction remains current-state tables plus revisions, idempotent commands, transactional outbox and bounded append-only critical audit records, not full event sourcing of every simulation event.

### `DUR-03` — Item Transaction and Anti-Duplication Contract

Decide, either in Persistence v1 or a separate contract:

- canonical item-instance identity and ownership;
- inventory/equipment/container/ground transfer atomicity;
- pickup, drop, loot, trade, reward, bank and depot retry behavior;
- idempotency and duplicate-command outcomes;
- stale-session and stale-writer rejection;
- crash and partial-failure rollback/recovery;
- audit evidence proving that items or currency cannot be duplicated;
- authoritative event semantics for create, destroy, split, merge, move, pickup, drop, loot, trade, market, mail, depot, reward, transform, currency credit/debit, commit, abort and rollback;
- deterministic conservation, provenance and single-authoritative-location invariants that can be independently reconciled by Game Intelligence.

### `DUR-04` — Content, World Detail and Scripting Contract

ADR-0005 accepts the native world format, Oteryn Studio, stable content identity, chunk/semantic geography separation, encounter-placement hierarchy and legacy-conversion boundary. Still decide:

- exact pinned Otheryn, Remere's Map Editor, Beats Assets Editor and other source revisions used as evidence or fixtures;
- classification of each source area as `COPY`, `CONVERT`, `REWRITE`, `REFERENCE_ONLY` or `REJECT` after licensing and provenance review;
- concrete versioned schemas and migration rules for maps, items, monsters, spells, NPCs, spawns, quests, events and assets;
- exact World Project and World Bundle encoding contracts;
- a bounded non-canonical format spike proving deterministic bundle hashes, random access, corruption/decompression failure, source-to-bundle-to-load equivalence and measured 32x32 versus 64x64 chunk/floor packing before final encoding is frozen;
- chunk-size/floor-packing benchmark and spatial indexing details;
- Content Registry package/version/dependency rules;
- client asset provenance and rights;
- scripting language/runtime;
- script API, world/channel/instance context and capability limits;
- CPU/time/memory budgets;
- failure isolation and error policy;
- persistence access policy;
- hot-reload policy;
- deterministic conversion tooling and fixture corpus.

Scripts must not receive a global mutable `Game` object or direct SQL access. Legacy tools and proprietary assets must not be copied without confirmed rights and pinned provenance.

## Cross-cutting Game Intelligence contracts

ADR-0006 accepts the subsystem direction. The following contracts freeze its implementable boundaries without creating runtime code in the architecture package.

### `ANL-01` — Game Event and Audit Foundation Contract

Decide:

- common versioned event envelope and event-family ownership;
- operational, best-effort telemetry and durable audit classifications;
- producers, consumers, ordering, causation/correlation and schema compatibility;
- bounded in-process queues, overload, drop and fail-open behavior for gameplay telemetry;
- transactional outbox/atomic audit behavior for economy and security mutations;
- idempotent delivery, deduplication, publication checkpoints and replay into read-only consumers;
- resource limits registered in `RESOURCE_LIMITS_REGISTRY.json`, backpressure, dead-letter lifecycle and observability;
- stable error/outcome mapping through `FOUNDATION_ERROR_VOCABULARY.md`;
- privacy classes, pseudonymous identity, access roles, retention, deletion/anonymization and legal hold;
- named analytics/audit/privacy/investigation scenarios from `FOUNDATION_FAILURE_SCENARIOS.md`;
- golden fixtures and duplicate/out-of-order/schema-evolution tests.

This contract must be accepted before `DUR-02` and `DUR-03` finalize the outbox/audit evidence required by their transactions. It does not block client migration or minimal workspace bootstrap after cutover.

### `ANL-02` — Gameplay, Balance and World Analytics Contract

Decide:

- hunt/session and aggregate semantics derived from explicit events;
- vocation/class, level, equipment/power, party, hunt-area and version dimensions;
- damage, healing, death, experience, spell, monster, supplies, loot and profit metrics;
- `Area`/`Subarea`/`EncounterZone`/`RaidCell`/`RaidAnchor` and technical region/chunk analysis;
- minimum sample sizes, confidence, regression comparison and misleading-series prevention;
- geography/privacy trade-offs, storage, retention, dashboards and reconciliation.

Analytics remains observational and may not change balance automatically.

### `ANL-03` — Economy Integrity and Security Analytics Contract

Decide:

- item/currency provenance consumers and deterministic invariant catalogue;
- alert and investigation-case lifecycle;
- bot, exploit, replay, cooldown, transfer-graph and protocol anomaly signals;
- detector/rule/model versioning, evidence references and false-positive handling;
- separation between deterministic enforcement in runtime and observational alerting;
- human authorization and audited disposition for sanctions or remediation.

This contract supplements but never replaces the prevention guarantees of `DUR-03`.

### `ANL-04` — Read-Only Investigation and AI Contract

Decide:

- read-only views, replicas and evidence-package APIs;
- case correlation, provenance reconstruction and report generation;
- model/rule provenance, confidence and human review;
- least-privilege credentials and full access auditing;
- hard prohibitions on runtime/database mutation, autonomous bans, balance changes, rollback, deployment and unsupported proof claims.

This is an expansion gate and is not required for the foundation vertical slice.

## `QA-E2E-01` — Native End-to-End Test Platform Contract

ADR-0007 accepts the architecture. Implementation must provide:

- one shared versioned scenario contract and orchestration platform;
- Tier 1 headless system E2E using production transport and `protocol-oteryn` through the supported Platform/Gateway path;
- Tier 2 instrumented native-client E2E whose test-only adapter may observe and submit normal actions but may not bypass admission or mutate authoritative state;
- Tier 3 smoke E2E using exact production-default release-candidate artifacts;
- deterministic seeds, clocks, topology and fault profiles;
- stable semantic observations and read-only probes rather than gameplay mutation shortcuts;
- one result envelope per attempt with exact revisions/hashes, ordered phases, first divergence and cleanup result;
- visible repeated-run populations with no hidden retry-until-green;
- PR/main/nightly/release placement proportional to tier and risk.

The canonical client must first be migrated through `VSL-02`. Protocol, admission, durable mutation and content scenarios consume their respective accepted contracts. `QA-E2E-01` blocks completion of `VSL-01`, not the current `FND-01` or migration work.

## `VSL-01` — Foundation Vertical-Slice Programme

Approve ownership, implementation order and evidence for this minimum scenario using the accepted `QA-E2E-01` platform and evidence contract:

1. client authenticates through Platform;
2. client receives world/channel directory data;
3. Gateway issues a bound Game Session;
4. Rust game server validates admission and acquires the character lease;
5. character enters a minimal native map;
6. movement is authoritative;
7. two clients observe each other on one channel;
8. one monster can be attacked and killed;
9. one corpse/loot result is produced;
10. one item is picked up through a retry-safe transfer;
11. combat, death, loot and pickup emit correlated versioned events;
12. durable item/pickup evidence is atomic with the authoritative mutation;
13. duplicate delivery/replay into analytics does not duplicate an item or analytical aggregate;
14. character state is checkpointed and saved;
15. logout is safe;
16. the character logs into another channel with inventory/progression preserved;
17. a simultaneous second login of the same character is rejected;
18. channel-local state remains isolated while world-shared state remains shared.

## Decisions required as the vertical slice expands

- position, direction and entity-lifetime encoding;
- movement, collision, pathfinding and visibility contracts;
- minimal combat, death, corpse, loot and attribution contracts;
- PvP, skull, frag and combat-lock scope;
- party membership versus shared-experience behaviour across channels;
- boss, raid, chest and daily-reward anti-hopping policy;
- encounter uniqueness and cooldown scope across channels;
- world communication and presence service boundary;
- event journal, transactional outbox, publication checkpoint and replay timing;
- gameplay/balance/world analytics dimensions and sample-quality policy;
- item/currency provenance, invariant monitoring and security case lifecycle;
- metrics, tracing, log redaction, pseudonymization, access control and differentiated retention;
- updater, asset signing and release security;
- supported client platforms and server architectures;
- quantitative capacity, latency, reconnect, RPO and RTO targets;
- Foundation, Playable Alpha, Beta and release scope.

## Registered gameplay and product decision horizon

The complete open-decision scope is canonical in `GAMEPLAY_AND_PRODUCT_ARCHITECTURE_HORIZON.md`.

- `GAME-CHAR-01` and `GAME-ITEM-01` are new durable-gameplay gates: character semantics must precede final `DUR-02`, and item semantics must precede final `DUR-03`.
- `GAME-ABILITY-01`, `GAME-AI-01` and `GAME-INTERACTION-01` are required before Playable Alpha gameplay breadth is claimed; bounded vertical-slice contracts may precede them.
- `PROD-LIVEOPS-01`, `PROD-COMPAT-01`, `SEC-CLIENT-01`, `DATA-PRIVACY-01`, `UX-I18N-A11Y-01` and `OPS-GM-01` are required before Playable Alpha operational completeness is claimed.
- `PERF-01` is required before Playable Alpha claims representative-load readiness or publishes supported channel, GameNode or world capacity.
- `OPS-CHANNEL-01` is required before automatic production channel scaling or production GameNode/channel recovery is claimed.
- `GAME-META-01`, `GAME-INSTANCES-01`, `GAME-WORLD-LIFECYCLE-01` and `INTEGRATION-API-01` are expansion gates.
- `PROD-ENTITLEMENTS-01` and `MOD-ECOSYSTEM-01` remain explicitly deferred until an owner decision activates them.

Registering a gate does not accept its implementation choice.

## Explicitly deferred

These do not block client migration, the initial workspace bootstrap after cutover or the foundation vertical slice when extension points remain safe:

- final house presence and entry topology;
- live migration of an active channel;
- partitioning one channel across multiple nodes;
- QUIC support;
- cross-world chat, guilds or parties;
- hundreds of dynamically created channels;
- `GAME-INSTANCES-01` complete dungeon/arena/matchmaking/spectator programme;
- full market implementation;
- all classic rulesets;
- final launcher/updater implementation;
- `MOD-ECOSYSTEM-01` public mod ecosystem;
- advanced client prediction;
- extraction of world services into independent deployable microservices.

## Programme task model

The canonical foundation task is a non-owning programme checkpoint. It preserves accepted state, dependencies and one next action, but it must not claim files or act as the implementation task for all contracts.

Every substantial gate uses its own:

- task ID containing the stable gate ID where practical;
- owner, owned paths and public contracts;
- dedicated branch and PR;
- focused validation, independent audit and exact-head CI;
- terminal archive and ownership release.

No package may edit another active package's owned contract without explicit coordination.

## Recommended decision and implementation order

```text
1. Accept FND-01 Workspace, Dependency and Existing-Rust Migration Contract
2. Accept VSL-02 Exact Rust Client Migration and Cutover Contract
3. Freeze and reconcile the exact source SHA, open PRs, tasks and post-inventory changes
4. Deliver one atomic Oteryn-v2 destination PR containing client migration, root-workspace creation/completion, dependency enforcement, protocol-canary isolation, provenance and validation
5. Squash-merge and verify the exact destination result
6. Merge the source-only otclient moved/non-canonical marker PR
7. Accept FND-ID-01 Foundation Identifier Vocabulary, including event/operation/transaction identities
8. Merge and lock the final canonical Platform native-contract correction
9. Accept FND-02 protocol-oteryn v1 Contract
10. Accept FND-03 Runtime Execution Contract, including clock and event-emission semantics
11. Accept FND-04 Identity, Game Session, Admission and Character Lease Contract
12. Accept DUR-01 full Identifier Contract for database and durable-state representation
13. Accept GAME-CHAR-01 before DUR-02 freezes the durable character schema
14. Accept GAME-ITEM-01 before DUR-03 freezes item behavior and transfer semantics
15. Accept ANL-01 Game Event and Audit Foundation Contract
16. Accept DUR-02 Persistence v1 Contract with transactional outbox/audit recovery
17. Accept DUR-03 Item Transaction and Anti-Duplication Contract, if not complete in DUR-02
18. Draft ANL-02 and ANL-03 on the accepted event/persistence/item foundations
19. Run the bounded world-format spike and complete DUR-04 under ADR-0005
20. Implement QA-E2E-01 incrementally as the client, protocol, admission, persistence and content prerequisites land
21. Accept PERF-01 before publishing supported capacity or claiming representative-load readiness
22. Accept OPS-CHANNEL-01 before automatic production channel scaling or production recovery behavior is claimed
23. Accept VSL-01 Foundation Vertical-Slice Programme with correlated event/audit evidence and named QA-E2E-01 tiers
24. Execute the separately authorized vertical-slice implementation programme
25. Accept GAME-ABILITY-01, GAME-AI-01 and GAME-INTERACTION-01 before Playable Alpha gameplay breadth is claimed
26. Accept PROD-LIVEOPS-01, PROD-COMPAT-01, SEC-CLIENT-01, DATA-PRIVACY-01, UX-I18N-A11Y-01 and OPS-GM-01 before Playable Alpha operational completeness is claimed
27. Complete ANL-02/ANL-03 before production-grade alpha analytics claims; defer ANL-04 until read-only investigation is authorized
28. Activate expansion/deferred gameplay-product gates only when their milestone or explicit owner decision requires them
```

Contracts may be developed in parallel only when ownership and dependencies do not overlap. Cross-repository changes require separate authorized tasks, branches and PRs with one coordination ID and explicit rollout order.

## Start gates

- `FND-01` must be accepted before the destination client/workspace shape is frozen.
- `VSL-02` must immediately follow `FND-01` and must pin source SHA, provenance, open-PR disposition, source freeze, cutover, history preservation, destination bootstrap sequencing and rollback before moving client code.
- The canonical destination workspace must be created or completed inside the one atomic Oteryn-v2 migration PR; no import-only destination PR, later workspace-consolidation destination PR or competing placeholder client is allowed.
- The separate otclient source-marker PR may merge only after the destination squash merge is immutable and verified; it carries no destination implementation.
- Squash-merge provenance must retain exact source SHA/range and machine-readable path mapping without claiming imported Git ancestry.
- `FND-ID-01` must be accepted after migration/cutover and before `FND-02` or `FND-04` freezes identifier meanings on the wire or in Game Sessions.
- `FND-02`, `FND-03` and `FND-04` gate canonical protocol, authoritative runtime and production admission/lease implementation respectively.
- `DUR-01`, `DUR-02` and `DUR-03` must be accepted before authoritative durable character, item or currency mutation.
- `GAME-CHAR-01` must be accepted before `DUR-02` finalizes the character schema; `GAME-ITEM-01` must be accepted before `DUR-03` finalizes item semantics.
- `GAME-ABILITY-01`, `GAME-AI-01` and `GAME-INTERACTION-01` are required before Playable Alpha gameplay breadth is claimed; bounded vertical-slice contracts may precede them.
- `PROD-LIVEOPS-01`, `PROD-COMPAT-01`, `SEC-CLIENT-01`, `DATA-PRIVACY-01`, `UX-I18N-A11Y-01` and `OPS-GM-01` are required before Playable Alpha operational completeness is claimed.
- ADR-0005 is the accepted world/content direction; `DUR-04` must be accepted before broad content import or durable scripting.
- `QA-E2E-01` must be implemented with its required exact evidence before `VSL-01` implementation is called complete; feature packages add scenarios and assertions, not competing lifecycle/evidence runners.
- `VSL-01` must name observable E2E evidence before implementation is called complete.
- `ANL-01` must be accepted before final `DUR-02`/`DUR-03` outbox and audit boundaries are frozen.
- `ANL-02`/`ANL-03` are required before production-grade balance/world and economy/security analytics claims; `ANL-04` remains a later read-only investigation gate.
- `PERF-01` must be accepted before publishing player/channel/GameNode/world capacity claims or calling Playable Alpha representative-load ready.
- `OPS-CHANNEL-01` must be accepted before automatic production channel scaling or production GameNode/channel recovery behavior is claimed.

## Current next action

Execute `docs/agents/prompts/OTV2_GLOBAL_ARCHITECTURE_DECISION_COORDINATOR.md` and draft, audit, accept, merge and archive `FND-01` — the **Workspace, Dependency and Existing-Rust Migration Contract**. Its terminal next action must be `VSL-02`, not an isolated workspace bootstrap.
