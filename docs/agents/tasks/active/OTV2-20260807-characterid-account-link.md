## Outcome

Record the owner-accepted decision that `CharacterId` is a globally unique, strongly typed full-128-bit UUIDv7 issued by the game-domain Character authority; it is not semantically scoped by `WorldId`, survives rename and world transfer, is never reused after deletion, and is linked explicitly to Platform-owned `AccountId` so Platform WWW can consume an authorized AccountId-to-CharacterId projection.

## Architecture and source of truth

- `PROVEN`: the identifier baseline classifies CharacterId as durable cross-boundary identity.
- `PROVEN`: the UUIDv7 baseline selects UUIDv7 for CharacterId and names the character domain as logical generator.
- `PROVEN`: ADR-0003 keeps AccountId/Identity authority in Oteryn Platform.
- `OWNER_ACCEPTED`: on 2026-08-07 the project owner accepted the global CharacterId model, stable identity across rename/world transfer, non-reuse after deletion and direct Platform-WWW account linkage with separated ownership.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Define `CharacterId` as strongly typed UUIDv7 preserving all 128 bits.
- [x] Define CharacterId as global semantic identity rather than WorldId + CharacterId.
- [x] Assign canonical CharacterId issuance to game-domain Character authority.
- [x] Preserve AccountId ownership in Platform Identity.
- [x] Define explicit validated AccountId -> CharacterId[] relationship for Platform WWW projections.
- [x] Preserve CharacterId across rename and world transfer.
- [x] Keep character name and current WorldId as mutable state rather than character identity.
- [x] Forbid CharacterId reuse after deletion and preserve tombstone/audit direction.
- [x] Keep identity separate from session/lease/fencing authority.
- [x] Defer exact Platform API, projection schema, wire encoding, persistence and character lifecycle implementation to later contracts.
- [x] Do not implement Rust runtime, protocol, database or Platform behavior.
- [ ] Exact-head checks and independent audit before merge readiness.

## Excluded scope

No Rust runtime, character service implementation, account database mutation, protocol schema, database DDL, Platform WWW implementation, Bazaar implementation, production activation or completion of the full `FND-ID-01` catalogue.

No write to `blakinio/Oteryn-Platform` is authorized by this task.

## Validation

### Focused
- command/run: pending exact-head documentation/governance workflow
- result: pending

### Component/integration
- command/run: `NOT_APPLICABLE` — architecture documentation only
- result: `NOT_APPLICABLE`

### E2E
- scenario: `NOT_APPLICABLE` — no executable runtime behavior changes
- result: `NOT_APPLICABLE`

### Exact-head CI
- final head: recorded in immutable PR/check evidence after final content commit
