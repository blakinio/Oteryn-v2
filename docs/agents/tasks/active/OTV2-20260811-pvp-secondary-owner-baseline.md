## Outcome

Persist the owner's explicit acceptance that **PvP is a secondary pillar of Oteryn**: a serious, supported part of the product where enabled, but not the dominant organizing principle for the entire game.

## Architecture and source of truth

- `USER_SOURCE`: on 2026-08-11 the owner accepted the explicit recommendation `PvP = secondary pillar` after the three product-level options were described.
- `PROVEN`: `GAME-VISION-01_PREDECISION_ANALYSIS.md` lists launch-level PvP importance as owner-decision packet item 6.
- `PROVEN`: the accepted player promise preserves recognizable Tibia depth/risk/world identity while keeping exact PvP rules unresolved.
- `PROVEN`: Reference-first and hybrid Reference tracking require any Reference PvP parity claim to remain tied to a named immutable target revision.
- `PROVEN`: Evolved reliability/UX-first means the first Evolved package is not a broad PvP/gameplay redesign.
- `DERIVED`: secondary pillar means PvP is important and production-quality where enabled, but product scope may remain bounded and Oteryn must remain coherent for PvE/progression/economy/social players without making PvP the universal center of the design.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Record PvP as the owner-accepted `secondary pillar` product priority.
- [x] State that secondary does not mean low correctness/safety/fairness priority.
- [x] State that PvP is not the sole organizing principle for progression, economy, content or social play.
- [x] Preserve Reference parity authority and explicit/versioned/measurable Evolved differences.
- [x] Keep exact PvP world types, skull/frag/war/death/damage/reward formulas unresolved.
- [x] Keep disconnect timers, channel-switch cooldowns and anti-hopping thresholds unresolved.
- [x] Preserve server authority, durable-value integrity, anti-duplication, anti-cheat and recovery/channel safety guardrails.
- [x] Keep first product-proof PvP breadth bounded and explicitly milestone-scoped rather than implicitly exhaustive.
- [x] Include mandatory decision-timing, concrete blocked work, cost-of-delay and supersession-evidence records.
- [x] Keep full `GAME-VISION-01` explicitly `NOT ACCEPTED`.
- [x] No runtime/client/server/content/production implementation is authorized.
- [ ] Exact-head self-review and repository-required CI pass before merge.

## Excluded scope

This task must not:

- implement PvP, combat, death, reconnect, channel, anti-cheat, persistence or content behavior;
- select launch world types or PvP taxonomy;
- define skulls, frags, wars, unjustified kills, PvP rewards or rankings;
- define damage scaling, vocation balance or combat formulas;
- define death penalties, blessings or protection-loss mechanics;
- define safe-zone/protection-zone/PvP-area policy;
- define disconnect grace/post-grace behavior or logout-abuse enforcement;
- define channel-switch cooldowns, combat-lock durations or anti-hopping thresholds;
- define transfer rules between future PvP/non-PvP world types;
- alter accepted Reference-first, hybrid tracking, player-promise or Evolved reliability/UX-first decisions;
- modify parallel PR #162 repository-engineering/governance owned paths;
- authorize production rollout.

## Implementation / findings

- Current `main` at task start: `78c08e658cb4acb2f6e7298841b223d2ebf3cf5d`.
- Open PR at task start: #162 (`ci: enforce aggregate pull request merge gate`), currently a draft and owning repository-engineering/governance paths. No overlap exists with this task's two documentation paths.
- Repository search found no existing PvP secondary-pillar owner baseline.
- Added `docs/architecture/GAME-VISION-01_PVP_SECONDARY_PILLAR_OWNER_BASELINE.md` as a separate owner-accepted partial baseline.
- The owner acceptance resolves only `GAME-VISION-01` owner-decision packet item 6; detailed PvP policy remains intentionally open.
- The baseline explicitly distinguishes PvP feature breadth from PvP-sensitive safety/integrity invariants: breadth may be bounded by milestone, but correctness and exploit resistance cannot be weakened merely because PvP is secondary.

## Validation

### Focused

- command/run: compare owner acceptance with `GAME-VISION-01_PREDECISION_ANALYSIS.md`, accepted Reference/player-promise/Evolved baselines and ADR-0010; verify no existing owner PvP baseline; inspect parallel PR #162 for path collision
- result: **PASS** for declared product scope before final-head freeze; exact-head self-review still required after PR metadata checkpoint

### Component/integration

- command/run: `NOT_APPLICABLE` — architecture/task documentation only; no executable component/integration behavior changes
- result: `NOT_APPLICABLE`

### E2E

- scenario: `NOT_APPLICABLE` — no runtime/client/server/content behavior changes
- result: `NOT_APPLICABLE`

### Exact-head CI

- final head: pending PR creation/checkpoint
- trigger source: pending
- workflow/run/job: pending
- runner assignment: pending
- classification: repository-required documentation checks applicable to exact PR head
- result: pending

## Audit

- scope: owner-authority fidelity, PvP-priority overreach, accidental detailed PvP-rule freeze, Reference/Evolved conflict, safety/integrity weakening, milestone-scope ambiguity, task-template completeness, parallel ownership collision
- material findings: no material finding in focused pre-freeze review; exact-head audit pending
- unresolved findings: pending PR review-thread verification
- verdict: pending exact-head verification

## Self-review

- exact head: pending
- method/reviewer: implementing/coordinating agent full-diff product/architecture/governance review
- material findings: pending
- verdict: pending

## Independent review

- required: `NO` under current risk policy — bounded product-priority documentation only; this task does not change authentication/session, protocol/wire, persistence/economy conservation, production configuration or executable multichannel authority semantics
- exact head: `NOT_APPLICABLE`
- method/auditor: `NOT_APPLICABLE`
- material findings: `NOT_APPLICABLE`
- verdict: `NOT_APPLICABLE`

## PR and closeout

- changed-file review: pending exact final head
- unresolved review threads: pending
- related/superseded PRs: parallel disjoint draft PR #162; no supersession
- protected auto-merge: pending
- merge commit/result: pending
- ownership release: pending lifecycle archive after merge

## Context checkpoint

```yaml
last_progress: Owner accepted PvP as a secondary pillar; verified no existing canonical owner baseline or collision with draft PR #162 and added a narrow architecture baseline plus active task record.
