## Outcome

Record the owner-accepted decision that the destination-side Rust client migration, root-workspace creation/completion, accepted FND-01 crate dispositions, `protocol-canary` isolation and destination validation are delivered as one atomic pull request in `blakinio/Oteryn-v2`.

A later coordinated PR in `blakinio/otclient` may only mark the source path moved/non-canonical after the destination merge is immutable and validated; it is not a second destination implementation phase.

## Architecture and source of truth

- `PROVEN`: ADR-0002 makes `blakinio/Oteryn-v2` the canonical repository for client, server and shared Rust contracts.
- `PROVEN`: repository policy requires squash merge for delivery PRs.
- `DERIVED`: squash merge cannot preserve imported cross-repository commit ancestry as destination mainline ancestry.
- `ACCEPTED_OWNER_DECISION`: use one atomic destination PR and preserve history through immutable source retention, exact source SHA/range, machine-readable path/provenance mapping, copyright/license records and source links rather than claiming ancestry continuity.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] ADR-0002 requires one atomic destination PR and defines the separate source-marker rollout.
- [ ] The backlog and global register remove the option for a separate post-migration workspace-bootstrap PR.
- [ ] Provenance/history language is compatible with mandatory squash merge and does not claim false Git ancestry preservation.
- [ ] The programme checkpoint reflects the atomic destination package.
- [ ] No runtime, Cargo workspace, client source or external repository is modified.
- [ ] Governance validation passes on the exact final head.
- [ ] Independent full-diff audit finds no material contradiction.

## Excluded scope

- no execution of FND-01;
- no VSL-02 implementation or source SHA selection;
- no Rust workspace or client code migration;
- no write to `blakinio/otclient`;
- no protocol, runtime, identifier or admission implementation.

## Implementation / findings

- Owner selected one destination PR rather than separate import and workspace-consolidation PRs.
- The source repository remains immutable history/provenance evidence after cutover.
- The later source-marker PR is cross-repository closeout and cannot carry destination architecture or runtime changes.

## Validation

### Focused

- command/run: pending full changed-file review
- result: pending

### Component/integration

- command/run: `NOT_APPLICABLE` — architecture-only package
- result: `NOT_APPLICABLE`

### E2E

- scenario: `NOT_APPLICABLE` — no runtime behavior changes
- result: `NOT_APPLICABLE`

### Exact-head CI

- head: pending
- workflow/run: Agent governance
- result: pending

## Independent audit

- exact head: pending
- method/auditor: full architecture diff review
- material findings: pending
- verdict: pending

## PR and closeout

- changed-file review: pending
- unresolved review threads: pending
- related/superseded PRs: none known
- merge commit/result: pending
- ownership release: pending
