## Outcome

Record the owner-accepted invariant that one Platform-owned `AccountId` may have at most one authoritative gameplay character online at any moment across all of that account's characters, worlds, channels and instances.

## Accepted decision

- one `AccountId` -> at most one authoritative online `CharacterId`;
- the invariant is account-global, not world-local or channel-local;
- character switching must not create overlapping authoritative gameplay ownership;
- reconnect or transport overlap may exist only as a bounded transition if `FND-04` proves that exactly one authoritative gameplay lease/session remains valid;
- Platform web/OAuth sessions are not counted as an online gameplay character;
- exact duplicate-login policy (reject newcomer vs fenced replacement/handoff) remains unresolved for `FND-04`;
- exact `GameSessionId`, admission and character-lease representation/issuer/storage remain unresolved for `FND-04`;
- no runtime, protocol, database or Platform implementation is authorized by this task.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Define the concurrency scope at `AccountId` level.
- [x] Apply it across every CharacterId, WorldId, ChannelId and InstanceId owned/used by that account.
- [x] Preserve CharacterId identity independently from session/lease authority.
- [x] Require fail-closed prevention of two simultaneous authoritative gameplay characters for one account.
- [x] Keep reconnect/handoff mechanics deferred.
- [x] Keep Platform web authentication sessions outside this gameplay-presence invariant.
- [x] Do not implement runtime/protocol/persistence/Platform behavior.
- [ ] Exact-head checks and independent audit before merge readiness.

## Validation

Documentation-only architecture change. Exact-head repository checks and independent audit are required before merge readiness.
