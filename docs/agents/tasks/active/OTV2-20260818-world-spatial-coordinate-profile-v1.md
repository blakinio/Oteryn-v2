## Outcome

Merge one bounded Game-owned semantic spatial profile that gives native World/Content, Game -> Atlas export and later Atlas consumers explicit coordinate axes, bounds, floors/order, same-position presentation ordering and anchor/displacement semantics without promoting OTBM/Tibia/client projection conventions or a physical serializer into canonical authority.

## Architecture and source of truth

- **PROVEN:** ADR-0005 owns the native World/Content model and keeps OTBM behind bounded importer/Legacy IR boundaries.
- **PROVEN:** `OTERYN_GAME_ATLAS_EXPORT_CONTRACT_V1.md` requires an explicit `coordinate_profile` before executable producer/consumer compatibility.
- **PROVEN:** `OTV2-20260816-game-atlas-physical-profile-readiness.md` records `EVIDENCE_GAP` and names the exact missing spatial semantics.
- **PROVEN:** targeted preflight searches returned no open Atlas/spatial/coordinate PR or Issue, and the inspected active-task inventory exposed no task owning the target paths.
- **DERIVED:** a semantic profile can close this authority gap while leaving serializer/chunk/resource-limit decisions evidence-gated.
- **UNKNOWN:** the physical `Oteryn-Atlas` implementation repository remains unavailable/unproven and is not created or assumed by this task.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] One Game-owned profile defines horizontal axes/orientation and discrete coordinate numeric domain.
- [ ] Per-world bounds and point/rectangle inclusion are explicit and unambiguous.
- [ ] Floor identity/domain/order are explicit without copying legacy `z` semantics.
- [ ] Same-position presentation ordering is explicit and fail-closed for duplicates.
- [ ] Anchor/footprint/displacement meaning is explicit and renderer-resolution independent.
- [ ] Legacy import requires an explicit versioned mapping and cannot directly promote OTBM/Tibia conventions.
- [ ] Real alternatives/trade-offs/risks and supersession evidence are recorded under repository architecture-decision discipline.
- [ ] Serializer, compression, permanent chunk size/floor packing and production resource ceilings remain deferred.
- [ ] DYN-ATLAS readiness evidence truthfully distinguishes the closed coordinate-semantic gate from remaining Atlas-repository/fixture/assets/physical-profile gates.
- [ ] Full changed-file self-review finds no authority expansion outside this bounded Game contract.
- [ ] Exact-head documentation/governance merge gate passes.

## Excluded scope

- no Rust/runtime implementation;
- no World Project / World Bundle physical serializer;
- no Atlas browser implementation;
- no OTBM parser/importer implementation;
- no legacy Tibia `z=7` mapping decision;
- no chunk-size/floor-packing production decision;
- no asset redistribution or licensing decision;
- no production/staging/deployment mutation;
- no Platform/Otheryn writes;
- no repository create/rename/transfer/extraction.

## Implementation / findings

The profile is intentionally semantic. It uses explicit native Oteryn coordinates and ordering while requiring future legacy adapters to state their mapping. Historical `EVIDENCE_GAP` evidence remains immutable; a new readiness delta records the closure condition after merge.

Material design choices:

- signed `i32` horizontal tile coordinates;
- +X east/right and +Y south/down in canonical north-up projection;
- finite per-world half-open bounds with `i64` semantic bounds values so the full `i32` position domain can be represented without positive-edge overflow;
- signed `i16` canonical `FloorId`, with larger values higher/above, no universal meaning for floor zero and an explicit valid floor set;
- half-open rectangular inclusion;
- unique `(i32 plane, u32 order)` same-position presentation keys;
- explicit anchor-relative footprint offsets;
- presentation displacement direction/meaning fixed by the world profile while precision is bound by an explicit versioned appearance/asset `units_per_tile` profile rather than frozen here.

The profile does not assign concrete world extents or a legacy source-floor mapping.

### Self-review repairs before final-head freeze

Initial PR head `2d8a4ee4e46578849db27d9248adee83fb3634de` exposed two material design defects during semantic review:

1. half-open bounds encoded with the same `i32` type as positions could not represent an exclusive upper edge after `i32::MAX`;
2. hard-coding `1/256 tile` displacement precision unnecessarily froze an asset/render detail without evidence.

Head `cef45e577ccf82543b79198fd87a8652a37c2fcb` repaired those by widening only the bounds envelope, removing universal meaning from floor zero, widening presentation order fields and moving displacement precision into a required versioned appearance/asset unit profile.

The next full review found one governance/architecture-quality omission rather than a semantic contradiction: the contract did not explicitly compare realistic alternatives/trade-offs as required by `ARCHITECTURE_DECISION_DISCIPLINE.md`. The final pre-freeze repair adds a bounded decision-analysis section selecting the native explicit profile over legacy-canonical and consumer-defined alternatives, with risks, mitigations and future impact.

## Validation

### Focused

- command/run: GitHub exact changed-path/diff inspection plus repository governance validation selected by PR merge gate
- result: semantic/architecture self-review repairs complete; final exact-head pass pending

### Component/integration

- command/run: `NOT_APPLICABLE` — documentation-only semantic contract; no executable component changes
- result: `NOT_APPLICABLE`

### E2E

- scenario: `NOT_APPLICABLE` — no runtime/browser behavior is implemented by this task
- result: `NOT_APPLICABLE`

### Exact-head CI

- final head: pending
- trigger source: pull request to `main`
- workflow/run/job: pending
- runner assignment: pending
- classification: architecture/contracts-only
- result: pending

## Self-review

- exact head: pending
- method/reviewer: implementing/coordinating agent
- material findings: three pre-freeze findings repaired; final pass pending
- verdict: pending

## Independent review

- required: `NO` — bounded documentation-only semantic contract under existing ADR/export authority; no runtime, protocol wire, persistence, auth/security, production or authority-relaxation implementation changes. Owner explicitly authorized this blocking architecture task; exact-head self-review and normal merge gate remain mandatory.
- exact head: `NOT_APPLICABLE`
- method/auditor: `NOT_APPLICABLE`
- material findings: `NOT_APPLICABLE`
- verdict: `NOT_APPLICABLE`
