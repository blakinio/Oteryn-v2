## Outcome

Coordinate the minimum contracts and staged implementation gates required for the Oteryn v2 Rust workspace and first durable vertical slice without locking the project into an incorrect repository boundary, dependency graph, protocol, runtime topology, admission model, persistence design, world/content model or client migration path.

This file is the non-owning programme checkpoint. It preserves accepted state, dependencies and exactly one next action. It must not claim owned paths or act as the implementation task for all contracts.

Every substantial gate requires a separate package task with its own owner, paths, branch, PR, validation, audit, merge and archive lifecycle.

The exact ordered gates are maintained in `docs/architecture/FOUNDATION_DECISION_BACKLOG.md`. The complete wider decision horizon is maintained in `docs/architecture/GLOBAL_ARCHITECTURE_DECISION_REGISTER.md`. The self-contained coordinator prompt is `docs/agents/prompts/OTV2_GLOBAL_ARCHITECTURE_DECISION_COORDINATOR.md`.

The complete original 2026-08-05 handoff remains preserved unchanged at `docs/agents/evidence/OTV2-20260805-foundation-original-handoff.md` for traceability.

## Current repository state

### PROVEN

- At this checkpoint the repository contains architecture, governance and tools, but no accepted canonical root Cargo workspace.
- No complete `protocol-oteryn` Rust client-to-server gameplay implementation or native gameplay E2E is proven.
- The existing Rust client remains in `blakinio/otclient/oteryn-client` until `VSL-02` pins and moves it.
- Oteryn Platform contains Identity, World Registry, Game Login Ticket and a standalone Go Game Gateway.
- Existing producer-side native work does not prove the complete target runtime.
- ADR-0001 through ADR-0006 and their lifecycle closeouts/package state are merged or tracked on `main` as applicable.

Every replacement agent must verify this baseline against the live default branch before repeating it.

### ACCEPTED

1. **Native Rust target**
   - Rust client and authoritative Rust server;
   - one project-owned `protocol-oteryn`;
   - multichannel-first world model.

2. **Repository ownership**
   - the Rust client will move into `blakinio/Oteryn-v2`;
   - client, server and shared Rust crates will use one canonical repository/workspace;
   - `protocol-canary` is not part of the target runtime.

3. **Platform boundary**
   - Identity, OAuth/PKCE, MFA, Game Login Ticket, Game Gateway and World Registry remain in `blakinio/Oteryn-Platform`;
   - no second classic login server or credential authority is introduced;
   - the initial Game Gateway remains implemented in Go;
   - the Rust game server validates the bounded Game Session and owns gameplay admission/runtime.

4. **Persistence direction**
   - PostgreSQL is selected;
   - Platform and game use separate logical databases, owners, credentials and migration histories;
   - Redis is non-authoritative.

5. **Native world/content/editor direction**
   - Oteryn owns a greenfield native world/content format;
   - OTBM and historical formats are bounded conversion inputs rather than the canonical runtime model;
   - Oteryn Studio is the integrated map, asset and content authoring direction;
   - semantic `Area`/`Subarea` geography is separate from technical `Region`/`Chunk` partitioning;
   - dynamic encounter execution uses validated `EncounterZone`/`RaidCell`/`RaidAnchor` scopes.

6. **Game Intelligence direction**
   - one versioned event foundation supports separate gameplay/balance, world/content, economy/item and security consumers;
   - operational metrics, best-effort gameplay telemetry and durable transactional audit are distinct;
   - anti-duplication prevention remains in `DUR-03`;
   - investigation and AI are external, read-only and human-reviewed.

Canonical evidence: ADR-0001 through ADR-0006.

## Stable gate IDs

- `FND-01` — Workspace, Dependency and Existing-Rust Migration Contract.
- `FND-ID-01` — Foundation Identifier Vocabulary.
- `FND-02` — `protocol-oteryn` v1 Contract.
- `FND-03` — Runtime Execution Contract.
- `FND-04` — Identity, Game Session, Admission and Character Lease Contract.
- `DUR-01` — Durable Identifier Representation Contract.
- `DUR-02` — Persistence v1 Contract.
- `DUR-03` — Item Transaction and Anti-Duplication Contract.
- `DUR-04` — Content, World Detail and Scripting Contract.
- `VSL-01` — Foundation Vertical-Slice Programme.
- `VSL-02` — Exact Rust Client Migration and Cutover Contract.
- `ANL-01` — Game Event and Audit Foundation Contract.
- `ANL-02` — Gameplay, Balance and World Analytics Contract.
- `ANL-03` — Economy Integrity and Security Analytics Contract.
- `ANL-04` — Read-Only Investigation and AI Contract.

## Progressive implementation gates

### Before `FND-01`

The canonical root Cargo workspace remains blocked. Read-only discovery and architecture work are allowed. A disposable spike must be isolated, reversible and explicitly non-canonical.

### After `FND-01`

A separately authorized minimal workspace-bootstrap task may create the root Cargo workspace, the smallest immediately consumed members, toolchain/CI metadata and executable dependency-boundary checks.

The wider candidate crate list is a capability horizon, not an initial checklist. Empty placeholder crates and speculative abstractions are prohibited.

This bootstrap does not authorize canonical protocol, authoritative runtime, production admission/lease, durable gameplay, broad client migration or broad content import.

### Layer gates

- `FND-ID-01` gates freezing identifier meanings in protocol and admission schemas.
- `FND-02` gates canonical protocol schemas/codecs and production compatibility claims.
- `FND-03` gates authoritative runtime ordering, lifecycle and recovery.
- `FND-04` gates production Game Session validation, admission and character lease behavior.
- `DUR-01` through `DUR-03` gate authoritative durable character, item and currency mutation.
- `DUR-04` gates broad content import and durable scripting.
- `VSL-02` gates moving the Rust client source.
- `VSL-01` gates completion of the native foundation vertical slice.
- `ANL-01` gates final transactional event/outbox/audit boundaries used by persistence and item transactions.
- `ANL-02`/`ANL-03` gate production-grade analytics claims; `ANL-04` gates later read-only AI investigation.

## Remaining foundation contracts

### `FND-01` — Workspace, Dependency and Existing-Rust Migration Contract

- exact minimal initial applications, services and crates;
- pinned existing-Rust workspace inventory and migrate/rename/merge/split/rewrite/reference/drop disposition;
- immediate consumer and observable acceptance for every member;
- legal dependency directions and forbidden edges;
- canonical ownership of identifiers, domain types, protocol schemas, world/content schemas and fixtures;
- Rust edition/resolver/toolchain/`rust-version`/lockfile, workspace inheritance, feature and dependency policy;
- exact target triples and product-realistic target/feature CI matrix;
- retained machine-readable workspace-boundary contract and executable dependency-graph enforcement;
- criteria for later adding, splitting or merging crates.

### `FND-ID-01` — Foundation Identifier Vocabulary

- semantic ownership, scope, uniqueness, reuse, durability and visibility of the minimum cross-boundary IDs;
- canonical wire/Game Session encoding constraints;
- no premature PostgreSQL layout selection; full durable representation remains in `DUR-01`.

### `FND-02` — `protocol-oteryn` v1 Contract

- reconcile, revise or explicitly supersede the exact latest merged Platform native contract;
- populate the machine-readable cross-repository contract lock and reject mutable PR heads as canonical;
- transport, TLS/ALPN, framing, stable schema/IDL and hard limits;
- revisions, capabilities and downgrade prevention;
- sequencing, command IDs, replay/idempotency;
- snapshots, deltas, reconnect/reconciliation and golden fixtures.

### `FND-03` — Runtime Execution Contract

- node/world/channel/instance responsibilities;
- tick, monotonic/wall-clock and deterministic test-clock model;
- command ordering and bounded queues;
- overload/backpressure;
- parallel work and safe return to the channel writer;
- lifecycle, checkpoint, replay and recovery semantics.

### `FND-04` — Identity, Game Session, Admission and Character Lease Contract

- token/session format, issuer/audience and key rotation;
- expiry, consume/replay prevention and revocation;
- reconnect, capacity routing and channel/revision binding;
- session generation and duplicate-login fencing;
- lease owner, storage and timings;
- partition and dependency failure behavior.

The exact questions, gates and order are maintained in `FOUNDATION_DECISION_BACKLOG.md`.

## Required before durable gameplay mutation

- `DUR-01` identifier representation and visibility contract;
- `DUR-02` detailed Persistence v1 contract on PostgreSQL;
- `DUR-03` item transaction and anti-duplication invariants;
- `DUR-04` content/world-detail/scripting contract before broad import or durable scripts;
- `ANL-01` event and audit foundation before persistence/item contracts finalize their atomic evidence;
- `ANL-02`/`ANL-03` before production-grade analytics claims;
- `VSL-01` foundation vertical-slice programme with named observable evidence.

## Foundation vertical slice

The initial programme must prove at least:

1. Platform authentication and Gateway-issued Game Session;
2. Rust game-server admission and character lease;
3. entry to a minimal native map;
4. authoritative movement and two-player visibility on one channel;
5. one monster combat/death/loot path;
6. retry-safe item pickup;
7. correlated combat/death/loot/pickup events, atomic item audit and replay-safe analytics;
8. durable checkpoint and safe logout;
8. relog to another channel with shared character state preserved;
9. rejection of a simultaneous second session;
10. isolation of channel-local state and preservation of world-shared state.

## Wider global decision horizon

The global register preserves and stages movement, combat, inventory/economy, rulesets/scripting, client migration/architecture, World Project/Bundle/Registry/Studio, Game Intelligence/analytics/audit, raids/houses/social systems, security, updater, deployment, observability, testing, quantitative performance targets and product milestones.

These subjects must not be forgotten, but they must not be prematurely frozen when they do not block the current stage.

## Explicitly deferred

These do not block initial workspace bootstrap or the foundation vertical slice when safe extension points remain:

- final house presence/entry topology;
- live channel migration;
- partitioning one channel across multiple nodes;
- QUIC;
- cross-world chat/guilds/parties;
- hundreds of dynamic channels;
- complete instance and market programmes;
- all classic rulesets;
- final launcher/updater;
- public mod ecosystem;
- advanced client prediction;
- extraction of world services into independently deployable microservices.

## Package ownership model

- This programme checkpoint remains unassigned and owns no paths.
- Every substantial gate uses a separate task containing its stable gate ID where practical.
- Each package owns only its declared files and public contracts.
- Each package has one dedicated branch and PR.
- Package completion requires focused validation, independent audit, exact-head CI, squash merge, archive and ownership release.
- No package may expand its authority through governance edited on its own unmerged branch.

## Excluded scope

This programme checkpoint does not itself:

- create the Rust workspace;
- move client code;
- implement protocol crates or runtime;
- modify external repositories;
- migrate Platform to PostgreSQL;
- provision a database;
- import content or proprietary assets;
- select final house topology;
- claim any native E2E capability already exists;
- own files on behalf of future packages.

## Implementation / findings

- ADR-0002 resolved canonical repository ownership and client migration direction.
- ADR-0003 resolved the Platform Identity/Game Gateway boundary and retained the initial Go Gateway.
- ADR-0004 selected PostgreSQL and separate Platform/game database ownership.
- ADR-0005 accepted the native world/content model, Oteryn Studio and bounded legacy conversion direction.
- ADR-0006 accepted Oteryn Game Intelligence, separated observability/telemetry/durable audit, and introduced ANL-01 through ANL-04.
- `FOUNDATION_DECISION_BACKLOG.md` records stable IDs, progressive gates and the non-owning programme model.
- `GLOBAL_ARCHITECTURE_DECISION_REGISTER.md` records the staged complete project decision horizon.
- `OTV2_GLOBAL_ARCHITECTURE_DECISION_COORDINATOR.md` supports explicit read-only analysis and bounded execution.

## Validation

### Focused

- method: architecture/governance document validation on each package PR
- result: pending per future package

### Component/integration

- result: `NOT_APPLICABLE` until executable packages are introduced

### E2E

- result: `BLOCKED` until `VSL-01` is implemented

### Exact-head CI

- head: pending each package PR
- workflow: `Agent governance` plus later retained Rust/component workflows
- result: pending

## Independent audit

Every package PR must challenge omitted boundaries, circular dependencies, placeholder crates, duplicate authority, unsafe concurrency/replay/recovery, item duplication, cross-repository rollout conflicts, unsupported runtime claims, premature freezing and stale decisions.
