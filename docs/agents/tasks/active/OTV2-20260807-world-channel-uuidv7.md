## Outcome

Record the owner-accepted decision that the canonical target representation of `WorldId` and `ChannelId` is strongly typed UUIDv7 preserving all 128 bits, while canonical channel identity remains `WorldId + ChannelId` and Platform World Registry remains the issuer.

## Architecture and source of truth

- `PROVEN`: the durable-identity baseline already selects UUIDv7 for Oteryn-owned durable cross-boundary identity and previously left `WorldId`/`ChannelId` conditional on their authoritative cross-repository contract.
- `PROVEN`: the owner-accepted issuance baseline assigns canonical `WorldId` and `ChannelId` issuance to Platform World Registry / topology authority.
- `OWNER_ACCEPTED`: on 2026-08-07 the repository owner accepted UUIDv7 as the canonical target representation for both `WorldId` and `ChannelId`.
- `CONSTRAINT`: this Oteryn-v2 decision does not claim current Platform implementation conformance and cannot silently re-key externally owned identifiers; coordinated Platform adoption/migration remains required.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Record `WorldId = strongly typed UUIDv7`.
- [x] Record `ChannelId = strongly typed UUIDv7`.
- [x] Preserve all 128 bits across canonical boundaries.
- [x] Preserve semantic channel identity as `WorldId + ChannelId`.
- [x] Preserve Platform World Registry issuance authority.
- [x] Keep names/slugs/channel ordinals as labels rather than canonical identity.
- [x] Preserve strong type separation and reject UUID timestamp ordering as authority/causality.
- [x] Require explicit coordinated Platform adoption/migration and prohibit silent re-keying.
- [x] Leave exact wire byte order/text form to `FND-02` and physical persistence layout to `DUR-01`/`DUR-02`.
- [x] Do not implement runtime/protocol/persistence/Platform changes.
- [ ] Review complete diff and exact-head checks before merge readiness.

## Excluded scope

- no writes to `blakinio/Oteryn-Platform`;
- no Platform schema/data migration;
- no Rust implementation;
- no protocol IDL/framing/serialization choice;
- no database DDL/index choice;
- no production activation;
- no completion of the full `FND-ID-01` catalogue.

## Implementation / findings

A dedicated owner baseline records the representation decision without rewriting earlier evidence. The later decision resolves only the previous conditional representation wording for `WorldId` and `ChannelId`; all prior issuer, scope, fencing and cross-repository authority rules remain in force.
