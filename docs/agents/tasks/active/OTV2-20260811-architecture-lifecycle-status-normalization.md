## Outcome

Make current lifecycle/status documentation truthful after merged governance, FND-ID cleanup and dual-transport work; reconcile the completed Platform entitlement producer repair without claiming that the Oteryn-v2 game-side entitlement consumer/enforcement contract is accepted, implemented or activated.

## Architecture and source of truth

- `PROVEN`: Oteryn-v2 PR #146 merged exact final head `3755d79df011e11fa2e2a62188cf88b06e25df23` as squash merge `8f5f20274aa8c886695fb36dfe14025f38f1ee1b`.
- `PROVEN`: Oteryn-v2 PR #147 merged exact final head `7fe81934cc031c6c26b9c38993254de62840d493` as squash merge `81db47966d76709a0e44dfbf1bc3979f38a24ffa`.
- `PROVEN`: Oteryn-v2 PR #149 merged exact final head `641de04b1397cb910f6f26e7dd1594babb8ad1ac` as squash merge `05544969baf58c3a40354f366438d759bfd159e5` after exact-head self-review, Agent Governance, Dependency Review, CodeQL and required independent review all passed.
- `PROVEN`: Oteryn-Platform issue #944 / `OPA-SEC-0007` is closed `completed`; remediation PR #968 exact final head `27414684ceb77700c7bbf7c6a047c6f3c0c79ad9` merged as `afaa6d1d8340e44b1152b62d6d27e5fd1649804a`.
- `PROVEN`: the repaired Platform producer contract supplies finite authority validity, lifecycle/authority revision fencing, bounded stale/unavailable semantics, time-safety requirements and rollout/rollback validation obligations for Profile-B game-consumed entitlement authority.
- `DERIVED`: Platform #944 is no longer an open producer blocker, but Oteryn-v2 still lacks the accepted consumer/enforcement contract and runtime proof; Premium/VIP/game-consumed entitlement activation remains blocked.
- `PROVEN`: architecture/runtime status authority is `docs/architecture/FOUNDATION_PROGRAMME_CURRENT_STATUS.md`; older progress prose cannot override the current overlay.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Move the three already-merged task records (#146/#147/#149 owners) from `active/` to `archive/` with exact terminal evidence and release stale advisory ownership.
- [x] Refresh the non-owning foundation programme checkpoint so it no longer names completed FND-ID/FND-02/FND-03/FND-04 work as the next programme gate.
- [x] Update current programme status to `LIFECYCLE_CLOSED` for FND-ID-01 and NET-TRANSPORT-01 while preserving `NOT_STARTED` runtime claims.
- [x] Make ADR-0009/ADR-0015 GameNode wording in the status overlay unambiguous: one GameNode remains one process; modular monolith is only a nonbinding internal-decomposition hypothesis.
- [x] Reconcile `PROD-ENTITLEMENTS-01` with exact Oteryn-Platform #944/#968 producer evidence and preserve the missing Oteryn-v2 consumer/enforcement contract as the activation gate.
- [x] Preserve issue #115 as open work for the remaining consumer-side contract; do not close it merely because the producer prerequisite is satisfied.
- [x] Keep all repository edits documentation/governance-only; no runtime, dependency, workflow, Platform or production mutation.
- [ ] Mandatory exact-head self-review passes with zero material findings.
- [ ] Exact-head Agent Governance, Dependency Review and CodeQL pass.
- [ ] One independent final review passes because entitlement/security authority wording is changed.
- [ ] Squash merge succeeds on the unchanged reviewed head.

## Excluded scope

- no new gameplay/product owner decisions;
- no implementation of entitlements, Premium/VIP, GameNode, protocol, transport or persistence;
- no Platform repository write;
- no broad rewrite of historical ADR evidence;
- no Codex use except the genuinely required independent final review for entitlement/security authority wording.

## Implementation / findings

- Archived the stale post-merge task records for PRs #146, #147 and #149 with exact final-head/merge/check evidence; removed their stale `active/` copies.
- The active-task set is now limited to the long-lived non-owning foundation checkpoint, two intentionally still-active disconnect/forensics analyses, this cleanup task and the directory README.
- Rewrote the non-owning foundation programme checkpoint as current coordination state: accepted foundation architecture is not reopened; product semantics + bounded DUR-02 discovery + real-boundary vertical slices are the near-term direction.
- `FOUNDATION_PROGRAMME_CURRENT_STATUS.md` now records FND-ID-01 and NET-TRANSPORT-01 delivery lifecycles closed, while gameplay transport/runtime remains `NOT_STARTED`.
- `FOUNDATION_PROGRAMME_CURRENT_STATUS.md` also aligns GameNode guidance with ADR-0009/ADR-0015 instead of leaving the older prescriptive modular-monolith wording ambiguous.
- `PROD-ENTITLEMENTS-01_PLATFORM_GAME_ENFORCEMENT_DEPENDENCY.md` now pins Platform PR #968 / merge `afaa6d1d8340e44b1152b62d6d27e5fd1649804a` as satisfied producer evidence and keeps the game-side consumer contract/runtime activation explicitly unauthorized.
- No runtime/code/workflow/dependency/external-repository file is changed.

## Validation

### Focused

- base: `main@05544969baf58c3a40354f366438d759bfd159e5`
- current diff before final task checkpoint: exactly 10 documentation/task/architecture paths; `behind_by=0`
- active-task directory inspection: merged #146/#147/#149 task records absent; intended live coordination/analysis records preserved
- direct GitHub evidence: PRs #146/#147/#149 and Oteryn-Platform #944/#968 re-read before normalization
- result: PASS pending final exact-head recheck

### Component/integration

- result: `NOT_APPLICABLE` — documentation/governance status normalization only

### E2E

- result: `NOT_APPLICABLE` — no executable behavior change

### Exact-head CI

- final head: pending after this checkpoint commit
- trigger source: pull_request
- workflow/run/job: pending
- runner assignment: pending
- classification: documentation/governance/security-contract status only
- result: pending

## Self-review

- exact head: pending final head
- method/reviewer: implementing/coordinating agent full-diff review
- material findings: none known; final exact-head recheck pending
- verdict: pending

## Independent review

- required: `YES` — cross-repository entitlement/security authority wording is being reconciled
- exact head: pending
- method/auditor: one genuinely independent final reviewer; Codex only for this required gate if it is the available appropriate mechanism
- material findings: pending
- verdict: pending

## PR and closeout

- changed-file review: pending final head
- unresolved review threads: pending
- related/superseded PRs: #146, #147, #149 already merged; Platform #968 already merged
- protected auto-merge: pending
- merge commit/result: pending
- ownership release: pending
