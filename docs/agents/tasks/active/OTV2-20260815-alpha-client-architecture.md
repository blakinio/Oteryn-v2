repair_cycle_4_owner_override: explicit owner instruction on 2026-08-16 authorizing C/D/E/F continuation beyond the three-cycle stop
owner_review_constraint: no Codex for this continuation
```

`head_sha` is the immediately preceding repaired candidate revision. The exact final self-referential SHA is recorded externally on the PR/check/review evidence after this task commit exists.

## Outcome

Delivered the bounded `ALPHA-CLIENT-01` architecture package and completed **owner-authorized repair cycle 4** for the stable gate. The owner explicitly overrode the repository's ordinary three-cycle stop for C, D, E and F and instructed continuation to clean review/merge **without Codex**.

This repair closes the two material findings from the final review of `e2eb37e1d099d25dd87ebc02a68c111dd8dd91ac`:

1. settings persistence now has an explicit minimum `ACCOUNT` / `OS_USER` / `INSTALLATION` / `DEVICE` semantic scope model, deterministic precedence, privacy fail-closed behavior and versioned cross-scope migration rules;
2. the candidate now defines the reusable low-level Oteryn Studio sharing boundary, dependency direction, product-specific exclusions, content export/runtime projection seam and required conformance evidence.

All earlier repaired admission, wire-oracle, audio, directory-precision, production-codec and visual-scene boundaries remain preserved. Runtime/client/Platform implementation remains `NOT_STARTED`; no executable code, DDL or production state was modified.

PR: `#273`.

## Architecture and source of truth

- `PROVEN` — issue #263 and the parallel-work allocation assign worker E and exactly the three paths listed above.
- `PROVEN` — root `AGENTS.override.md` ordinarily stops after three repair cycles for one gate.
- `PROVEN` — the owner explicitly authorized exceeding that ceiling for C/D/E/F on 2026-08-16; the historical count remains preserved rather than reset.
- `PROVEN` — ADR-0003 requires Platform Identity -> one-time Game Login Ticket -> Platform-owned Game Gateway -> selected endpoint/channel/revisions + short-lived pre-admission material -> `protocol-oteryn` -> final game-owned FND-04 admission/CharacterLease/GameSession authority.
- `PROVEN` — ADR-0011/ADR-0016 preserve current fail-closed `pre-native-protocol` behavior and runtime-unavailable gameplay transports.
- `PROVEN` — current `crates/platform-client/src/lib.rs` recursively rejects only the 12 literal keys `host`, `port`, `endpoint`, `endpoint_uri`, `protocol`, `protocol_profile`, `ticket`, `credential`, `game_session`, `admission`, `route`, `address`; complete-schema/unknown-field rejection is not currently proven.
- `PROVEN` — FND-02 requires generation/sequence/revision/snapshot reconciliation and independent wire evidence against common-mode codec defects.
- `PROVEN` — ADR-0007 Tier 1 must speak the production transport and use the same production schemas, codecs, sequencing and admission contracts as the native client.
- `PROVEN` — `ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS_GAP_REGISTER.md` registers renderer/scene, settings/account-device scope and reusable Studio/client low-level component boundaries as part of `ALPHA-CLIENT-01`.
- `PROVEN` — DUR-04 client-safe content/revision discipline applies to visual/audio presentation assets and the Studio-export/client-ingest runtime projection boundary.
- `UNKNOWN` — exact gameplay transport implementation APIs, scene graph/animation/lighting/particle technology, renderer/UI/audio libraries, updater/signing, installer, secure credential storage, account-profile synchronization backend, exact shared crate/package names and numeric resource maxima remain deliberately unfrozen.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Screen/composition/provider, runtime/session, protocol/reconciliation, renderer/UI/input, content, filesystem/config, diagnostics, update/install, Windows-first and E2E boundaries remain defined.
- [x] Current `pre-native-protocol` behavior remains fail closed and no unavailable transport is exposed as runtime-ready.
- [x] ADR-0003 ticket/Gateway/pre-admission/final-game-authority chain remains explicit with no directory shortcut.
- [x] Independent FND-02 wire evidence remains required in addition to product-path E2E.
- [x] Tier 1 explicitly exercises the supported production transport and production schemas/codecs/sequencing/admission path; test-only codecs cannot substitute for shipping-codec coverage.
- [x] Audio remains application-owned, client-safe/revision-compatible, bounded and presentation-only without a selected library/vendor.
- [x] Platform-directory current-state claim remains narrowed to the exact 12-key recursive denylist.
- [x] Visual scene/presentation ownership is explicit and remains non-authoritative/reconstructable/bounded.
- [x] Durable settings declare semantic account/OS-user/installation/device scope and deterministic precedence; privacy opt-out cannot be weakened by a less restrictive layer.
- [x] Selected audio output and other hardware-specific choices are device-scoped; portable account preferences require an accepted account-profile owner rather than invented local authority.
- [x] Oteryn Studio may share only representation-neutral/non-authoritative low-level components; product composition/session/UI/authoring boundaries remain separate and dependency direction is acyclic.
- [x] Studio authoring state reaches the client only through a revisioned client-safe export/projection boundary; authoring-only/server-only state cannot become runtime client content by shared-type convenience.
- [x] `DECISIONS_NOT_TAKEN` records deferred concrete libraries, shared-package naming/publication and settings synchronization implementation.
- [x] Foreign-domain findings remain report-only; no runtime/client/server/protocol/DDL/Platform/production or coordinator-overlay path is intentionally modified.
- [x] Changed paths remain within worker-E ownership.
- [ ] Exact-final-head full-diff self-review and exact-head CI are recorded externally after this task commit.
- [ ] Required genuinely independent non-Codex review on the unchanged exact head is clean.

## Excluded scope

No executable client, Studio, scene, renderer, audio, networking, protocol, server or Platform implementation; no gameplay authority rewrite; no DDL/migration; no production activation; no credential/token representation; no concrete shared crate/package publication; no cross-repository write; no concrete account-profile backend; no concrete scene graph, camera, animation, lighting, particle/effects, audio, UI or renderer library selection; no coordinator-only global overlay edit; no lifecycle archive/ownership release before lawful merge.

## Implemented architecture repairs

### Earlier P1 — admission chain

Preserved explicit ADR-0003 fresh-entry chain through Game Login Ticket and Platform-owned Game Gateway before FND-02 transport and final game-owned FND-04 authority.

### Earlier P1 — independent wire oracle

Preserved canonical byte goldens, malformed/adversarial fixtures, properties, fuzzing, cross-version fixtures, resource ceilings and stable failure classes as independent evidence against common-mode production-codec defects.

### Earlier P2 — audio boundary

Preserved application-owned audio provider/device lifecycle, client-safe/revision-compatible assets, bounded resources, non-authoritative degradation, settings/accessibility and evidence ownership without choosing technology.

### Earlier P2 — Platform-directory precision

Preserved exact current 12-key denylist truth and future-only complete-schema/reject-unknown-field requirement.

### Earlier P1 — production codec path in Tier 1

Preserved mandatory production transport plus the same production schemas/codecs/sequencing/admission contracts. Independent wire evidence supplements rather than replaces that product code path.

### Earlier P2 — visual scene/presentation boundary

Preserved `apps/client` composition ownership of scene/presentation lifetime and the non-authoritative, reconstructable, revision-compatible, bounded scene/camera/animation/lighting/particles/effects boundary.

### Repair-cycle-4 P2 — settings account/device ownership

Repaired. The candidate now defines semantic `ACCOUNT`, `OS_USER`, `INSTALLATION` and `DEVICE` scopes, requires each durable setting to declare scope, defines deterministic default precedence for multi-scope user preferences, makes installation state non-generic, makes privacy/security restrictions dominate convenience precedence, scopes hardware selections such as audio output to `DEVICE`, and requires explicit versioned conflict/rollback rules for scope migration.

### Repair-cycle-4 P2 — Oteryn Studio sharing boundary

Repaired. The candidate permits only low-level representation-neutral/non-authoritative sharing, prohibits product composition/session/UI/authoring state from becoming shared contracts, requires acyclic dependency direction, keeps Studio authoring data behind revisioned export/client-safe projection, and names dependency/content-compatibility/negative evidence required before implementation acceptance.

## DECISIONS_NOT_TAKEN

No exact UI toolkit; scene graph/entity-presentation framework; camera algorithm; animation runtime; lighting model; particle/effects engine; shader architecture; renderer backend; audio library/vendor; exact shared client/Studio crate/package names or publication mechanism; account-profile synchronization backend; promotion/replacement of synthetic client crates; prediction/rollback algorithm; gameplay transport implementation or QUIC activation; Gateway/admission/reconnect token/API shape; protocol/TLS/protobuf library; content bundle/patch/CDN format; installer/updater/signing provider; exact Windows paths; credential vault; crash backend/retention; release-channel/version-skew policy; Linux/macOS commitment; numeric scene/effect/audio/network/cache limits; server/gameplay/persistence/balance authority.

## CROSS_DOMAIN_FINDINGS

The companion analysis retains the existing report-only findings for protocol runtime, admission/session integration, content/release tooling, security/release/SRE, QA/E2E and diagnostics/privacy. The cycle-4 repairs do not grant authority to mutate those owners. Any future account-profile synchronization or cross-repository Studio package publication requires the appropriate owning contract/owner authorization; this candidate only fixes the client-side scope/dependency boundary.

## Validation

### Focused

- final changed-file/full-diff review: pending exact-final-head inspection after current-main reconciliation
- settings-scope review: candidate contains explicit ACCOUNT/OS_USER/INSTALLATION/DEVICE rules, default precedence, privacy restrictive-wins and migration requirements
- Studio-boundary review: candidate contains explicit shared/non-shared responsibilities, dependency direction and content projection/evidence rules

### Component/integration

- `NOT_APPLICABLE` — paper-only architecture repair; no executable component changed

### E2E

- `NOT_APPLICABLE` for this delivery — the contract defines future Tier 1/Tier 2/Tier 3 obligations but does not implement them

### Exact-head CI

- current final head: recorded externally on PR #273 after current-main reconciliation
- required Agent governance / Merge authority / Merge gate: pending exact final head

## Self-review

- required: YES
- exact head: external PR evidence after current-main reconciliation
- method: full changed-file, full-diff, authority/dependency, regression and owner-override review
- verdict: pending exact-final-head pass

## Independent review

- required: YES
- exact head: must be the unchanged final repair head
- allowed method: genuinely independent fresh separate agent/session, qualified human reviewer or dedicated audit mechanism that actually evaluates the architecture diff
- Codex: **NOT TO BE USED** for this continuation per explicit owner instruction
- verdict: pending

## PR and closeout

- PR #273 remains open and unmerged during repair validation.
- Prior historical review threads remain resolved; the two current P2 threads may be resolved only after exact-head repair proof.
- No archive or ownership release before merge.
- **Stable-gate repair budget:** historical ordinary ceiling was 3; current count is `repair_cycles_for_current_gate: 4` under the explicit 2026-08-16 owner override. The override permits continued bounded repair; it does not reset history or weaken any other gate.
