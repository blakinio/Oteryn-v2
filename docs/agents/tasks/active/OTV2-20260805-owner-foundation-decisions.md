## Outcome

Persist the owner decisions made on 2026-08-05 so future work does not depend on chat history:

- move the native Rust client into the Oteryn v2 repository;
- keep Identity and Game Gateway in Oteryn Platform;
- keep the initial Game Gateway implementation in Go;
- do not create a second classic login server or password/OAuth authority;
- use PostgreSQL as the target database technology;
- keep Platform and game persistence in separate logical databases with separate owners;
- record truthfully that `protocol-oteryn` is not yet implemented end to end.

## Architecture and source of truth

### PROVEN

- ADR-0001 establishes the native Rust client/server stack, `protocol-oteryn`, multichannel-first runtime and external Platform authority.
- The current native Rust client remains in `blakinio/otclient/oteryn-client` and does not have an implemented `protocol-oteryn` crate.
- Oteryn Platform contains a standalone Go Game Gateway and disabled-by-default producer-side native protocol support.
- No authoritative Rust game server or complete native gameplay E2E currently exists.

### ACCEPTED

- ADR-0002 makes `blakinio/Oteryn-v2` the future canonical repository for client, server and shared Rust protocol/domain crates.
- ADR-0003 keeps Platform Identity and Game Gateway in `blakinio/Oteryn-Platform`, retains Go for the initial Gateway and assigns the Rust server only the Game Session admission/gameplay boundary.
- ADR-0004 selects PostgreSQL and separate `oteryn_platform` / `oteryn_game` ownership boundaries.

### UNKNOWN / deferred

- exact client migration source SHA and history mechanism;
- exact Cargo workspace graph;
- exact `protocol-oteryn` v1 framing and IDL reconciliation;
- exact Game Session token, key rotation, replay and lease behaviour;
- detailed PostgreSQL schema, migration, isolation, backup and recovery contract;
- actual Platform database migration implementation.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Client migration direction and canonical repository are recorded.
- [x] Platform Identity and Game Gateway ownership are recorded.
- [x] The initial Go Gateway decision and later-rewrite gate are recorded.
- [x] No second login/password/OAuth authority is permitted.
- [x] Current native protocol state is not overstated.
- [x] PostgreSQL and separate Platform/game databases are recorded.
- [x] Cross-system SQL ownership and Redis non-authority are recorded.
- [ ] Exact-head governance CI passes.
- [ ] Independent audit has zero open material findings.
- [ ] PR is squash-merged and this task is archived.

## Excluded scope

- no runtime implementation;
- no Rust workspace creation;
- no client code migration;
- no write to external repositories;
- no Gateway rewrite;
- no native protocol activation;
- no database provisioning or production migration.

## Implementation / findings

- Added ADR-0002 for repository ownership and client migration.
- Added ADR-0003 for Identity, Game Gateway and admission boundaries.
- Added ADR-0004 for PostgreSQL and separate data ownership.
- Preserved the existing full foundation-preimplementation checkpoint after audit identified that replacing it would remove useful detailed requirements.

## Validation

### Focused

- method: repository governance workflow and complete diff review
- result: pending exact-head run

### Component/integration

- result: `NOT_APPLICABLE` — documentation-only architecture work

### E2E

- result: `NOT_APPLICABLE` — no executable runtime outcome

### Exact-head CI

- head: pending final task-record commit
- workflow/run: `Agent governance`, pending
- result: pending

## Independent audit

- exact head: pending final task-record commit
- method/auditor: adversarial complete-diff review against ADR-0001, live Platform/otclient evidence and owner decisions
- material findings:
  - resolved: initial task-file replacement removed detailed foundation content; original blob restored before readiness
- verdict: pending final exact-head review

## PR and closeout

- changed-file review: four intended paths after final task record
- unresolved review threads: none observed
- related/superseded PRs: none
- merge commit/result: pending
- ownership release: pending

## Context checkpoint
