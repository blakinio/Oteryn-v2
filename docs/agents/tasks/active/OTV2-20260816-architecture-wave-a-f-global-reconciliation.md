## Outcome

Make coordinator-owned programme truth match the completed first A-F architecture wave without promoting any merged `PROPOSED`/`CANDIDATE` contract to `ACCEPTED` unless an existing owner baseline already does so. Remove the obsolete pre-wave next action, close stale issue #218 after proving its manifest goal is already delivered, and leave exactly one truthful next paper-only programme action.

## Architecture and source of truth

### PROVEN

- live task base is `main@c197ba12cc1b2ebbc4b27eab5d6054037720c48a`;
- A #271, B #268, C successor #276, D successor #277, E #273 and F #270 are merged and lifecycle-closed;
- C predecessor #272 and D predecessor #269 are closed without merge as superseded historical evidence;
- Agent A preserves 0/4 promoted `ABILITY_COMBAT` cases, with target `UNKNOWN`, provenance/legal `PENDING`, implementation `NOT_STARTED`, parity `PARITY_PENDING_EVIDENCE`;
- B/E/F candidate headers remain `CANDIDATE`; C/D successor packages remain `PROPOSED` architecture rather than owner-accepted architecture; implementation remains `NOT_STARTED`;
- issue #218 describes creation of the Reference evidence/parity manifest, but the manifest and later owner acceptance were already delivered by merged PRs #220 and #252.

### DERIVED

The first-wave delivery programme is complete under the allocation completion condition, but the architecture decision programme is not complete: merged candidate packages that are not already owner-accepted still require explicit later acceptance before they become binding implementation authority. `GAME-ABILITY-01` is the narrowest high-leverage next owner-decision candidate because it composes already accepted partial GAME-ABILITY baselines and gates broad combat/ability implementation while leaving Reference parity separately fail-closed.

### Preservation choice

`GAMEPLAY_AND_PRODUCT_ARCHITECTURE_HORIZON.md` and `ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS_GAP_REGISTER.md` are broad historical inventories with substantial still-valid detail. Rewriting them wholesale merely to replace stale execution wording would create unnecessary semantic-loss risk. This task therefore preserves those files byte-for-byte and adds `OTERYN_V2_POST_WAVE_A_F_RECONCILIATION_20260816.md`, which explicitly supersedes **only** their stale execution-status/coverage/next-action wording. Their detailed inventory/risk/future-decision content remains valid unless separately superseded.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] `FOUNDATION_PROGRAMME_CURRENT_STATUS.md` reflects post-wave A-F delivery truth and no longer selects Agent A evidence acquisition as future work.
- [x] global register distinguishes merged/lifecycle-closed candidate delivery from architectural `ACCEPTED` status.
- [x] a narrow reconciliation overlay supersedes only stale status/coverage/next-action wording in the broad gameplay horizon and gap register while preserving their detailed historical inventory.
- [x] architecture index points readers to the post-wave reconciliation and delivered first-wave packages with truthful status wording.
- [x] non-owning foundation checkpoint uses live post-wave state and exactly one next action.
- [ ] stale issue #218 is closed as completed with exact merged evidence; issue #115 remains open and unchanged.
- [x] no accepted ADR/contract semantics, runtime/client/server/protocol/DDL/Platform/production behavior or external repository is changed.
- [ ] full final diff self-review has zero material findings.
- [ ] exact-head required repository checks pass and review threads are zero.

## Excluded scope

No owner acceptance of GAME-ABILITY/GAME-AI/GAME-INTERACTION/ALPHA-CLIENT/ANL-02/ANL-03; no candidate semantic rewrite; no runtime implementation; no Rust/client/server/protocol/content change; no DDL/migrations; no Platform/external-repository write; no production action; no governance/authority change; no Codex/OpenAI/owner-funded AI.

## Implementation / findings

Coordinator reconciliation only. Historical worker/task evidence remains immutable. Status updates use `ARCHITECTURE_STATUS_MODEL.md`: a merged and lifecycle-closed candidate can be `CANDIDATE | LIFECYCLE_CLOSED | NOT_STARTED`; delivery completion does not imply owner acceptance.

The selected next paper-only action is a bounded `GAME-ABILITY-01` owner-decision package. It is an owner-decision task, not runtime implementation and not Reference parity work.

## Validation

### Focused

- command/run: repository governance/document checks through GitHub merge gate after final head
- result: pending

### Component/integration

- command/run: `NOT_APPLICABLE` — coordinator-only documentation/status reconciliation
- result: `NOT_APPLICABLE`

### E2E

- scenario: `NOT_APPLICABLE` — no executable user/runtime behavior changes
- result: `NOT_APPLICABLE`

### Exact-head CI

- final head: pending
- trigger source: pending
- workflow/run/job: pending
- runner assignment: pending
- classification: pending
- result: pending

## Self-review

- exact head: pending
- method/reviewer: architecture coordinator full changed-file/diff audit
- material findings: pending
- verdict: pending

## Independent review

- required: NO — low-risk coordinator-owned status/bookkeeping reconciliation only; no semantic acceptance, governance safety change, authority expansion or implementation change
- exact head: `NOT_APPLICABLE`
- method/auditor: `NOT_APPLICABLE`
- material findings: `NOT_APPLICABLE`
- verdict: `NOT_APPLICABLE`
