## Outcome

Deliver a bounded evidence package for exactly the four registered `ABILITY_COMBAT` Reference cases in issue #259. Promotion requires admissible evidence that captures or bridges `global-tibia-observable-2026-07-28-post-server-save` and satisfies provenance/legal requirements; insufficient evidence remains fail-closed `UNKNOWN / PENDING`.

**Research outcome: `INSUFFICIENT_FOR_PROMOTION`; 0/4 cases promoted.**

Draft PR #271 is the worker handover artifact. Merge and lifecycle closeout remain coordinator-only.

## Architecture and source of truth

- **PROVEN:** coordinator comment on issue #259 activated this worker lane from reviewed orchestration base `088b46638ac014cd7928d6b0b75cee44902fe22c` and requires work to start from this branch/trusted base.
- **PROVEN:** live `main@cb98fd32a2bb71fce83234ebf8bf69bdd1a1970e` has exactly that worker base as its parent; the later #267 commit is orchestration lifecycle closeout and explicitly preserves the activated A-F lanes unchanged.
- **PROVEN:** the accepted continuity contract requires evidence from the 2026-07-28 boundary for post-target observations and says patch-note/search absence is not continuity proof; provenance other than `CLEARED` blocks promotion.
- **PROVEN:** manifest revision 3 contains exactly the four scoped cases from PR #255. Each is target `UNKNOWN`, Oteryn `NOT_STARTED`, parity `PARITY_PENDING_EVIDENCE`, with source/case provenance and legal review `PENDING`.
- **PROVEN RESEARCH:** exact Light Healing and Ice Strike Library locators still surface expected metadata/descriptions through official-domain search indexing, but direct opens return HTTP 403.
- **PROVEN RESEARCH:** search-index freshness is approximate only (`2 weeks` for exact spell pages; `3 weeks` for an aggregate spell-list surface), with no exact crawl timestamp tying a capture to the 2026-07-28 post-server-save state.
- **PROVEN RESEARCH:** July 27/28 official News Archive/search indexing surfaces the maintenance/change boundary and selected July 28 changes; exact E1/E2 article IDs were not independently verified and are not asserted. E6 has a separately verified exact official News Ticker locator, `id=8901&subtopic=newsarchive`.
- **PROVEN RESEARCH:** omission of these spells from July 27/28 news is inadmissible as continuity proof. The delayed Echo Raid disclosure remains methodological evidence for the accepted no-silence-inference risk, not spell evidence.
- **UNKNOWN:** a provenance-cleared exact-time capture or affirmative continuity chain may exist elsewhere, but the bounded research did not obtain one.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Preflight evidence table records all four target cases and their current `UNKNOWN / PENDING` blockers.
- [x] Research is bounded to the four issue #259 cases and records verified exact official locators where independently demonstrable, explicitly classifies broad News Archive/search surfaces where exact article identity is not proven, and records retrieval mode, timing relation, provenance limitations, uncertainty and conflict handling in `docs/agents/evidence/OTV2-20260815-ability-combat-reference-continuity.md`.
- [x] Every case has explicit promotion rejection reasoning; all four retain `UNKNOWN`, provenance/legal `PENDING` and `PARITY_PENDING_EVIDENCE`.
- [x] Patch-note/search silence, approximate crawl ages, community documentation, OTS similarity and implementation convenience are explicitly rejected as independent continuity proof.
- [x] Conditional manifest/fixture changes were not made because evidence does not change an existing classification or provenance state; no contract defect requiring clarification was found.
- [x] Manifest integrity verified by identical blob SHA `f5828732038ac2fd3ae03f3d1793505d48a61122` on worker branch and trusted base; first evidence/fixture package integrity verified by identical blob SHA `5c9961a99616839a40b3ca933ac4371f93ffca48`.
- [x] No runtime/client/protocol/DDL/Platform/production or external-repository write was performed; no proprietary code/assets or restricted material were used.
- [x] Draft PR #271 was created against `main` and its pre-final-metadata diff contained exactly the two Agent A-owned files.
- [x] Complete pre-repair patches for both changed files were inspected; the coordinator's locator-integrity finding is addressed by the bounded repair and requires a fresh exact-head coordinator re-audit.
- [ ] Exact repaired-head repository governance/PR checks and coordinator re-audit are external PR/check evidence generated after the repair commits; the exact final SHA is recorded externally because a commit cannot contain its own SHA.

## Excluded scope

No mechanic-inventory expansion; no formulas/range/legality discovery beyond the four registered case boundaries; no runtime/client/server/protocol/persistence/content implementation; no DDL, Platform or production authority; no external-repository writes; no proprietary/restricted evidence; no coordinator-owned overlay edits; no issue close, task archive, merge, auto-merge or lifecycle publication.

## Implementation / findings

### Evidence result

The audit-ready source matrix and four-case analysis are in `docs/agents/evidence/OTV2-20260815-ability-combat-reference-continuity.md`.

The research found official-domain corroboration but not admissible continuity/provenance clearance:

- exact Light Healing and Ice Strike Library locators remain search-index readable while direct opens return HTTP 403;
- index freshness is approximate and has no exact timestamp;
- the aggregate official spell list has approximate crawl age and incomplete case-aspect coverage;
- E1/E2 exact Tibia news article IDs were not independently verified, so their formerly malformed/broad result URLs are no longer represented as exact source identities;
- E6 exact official News Ticker locator was independently verified as `https://www.tibia.com/news/?id=8901&subtopic=newsarchive`;
- July 27/28 official news cannot prove continuity through omission;
- the accepted no-silence-inference rule is supported methodologically by the official delayed Echo Raid disclosure.

Therefore the correct evidence action is **rejection of promotion**, not a manifest update.

### Self-repair findings

1. Initial task bookkeeping used incorrect full SHAs copied from a truncated preflight summary; direct GitHub inspection repaired them.
2. Preflight initially treated the post-activation main lifecycle commit as a stale-branch problem; coordinator issue comments prove this branch was intentionally activated from `088b46638...`. No force move occurred.
3. Initial task ownership over-declared `REFERENCE_EVIDENCE_PARITY_MANIFEST_CONTRACT.md`; ownership was corrected to only the Agent A task record and new evidence artifact.
4. Full PR file review confirms no conditional manifest/package or coordinator-overlay changes entered the diff.
5. Coordinator re-audit found malformed Tibia-news query strings for E1/E2/E6. Repair reclassified E1/E2 as broad official News Archive/search-surface evidence because exact article IDs could not be independently verified, replaced E6 with its verified exact ticker locator, and removed wording that overstated exact-source identity. No case classification was promoted.

## Validation

### Focused

- four-case source/classification matrix: **PASS**.
- fail-closed classification discipline: **PASS** — 0/4 promoted.
- news-locator provenance repair: **PASS** — E1/E2 exact article IDs are explicitly `NOT VERIFIED`; E6 exact ticker locator is verified; malformed/broad query strings are not represented as exact source identity.
- exact changed-file scope before repaired-head external checks: **PASS** — only task + evidence artifact are intended.
- conditional manifest blob check: **PASS** — branch/base SHA both `f5828732038ac2fd3ae03f3d1793505d48a61122` before this repair; manifest remains outside the changed-file set.
- conditional first evidence/fixture package blob check: **PASS** — branch/base SHA both `5c9961a99616839a40b3ca933ac4371f93ffca48` before this repair; fixture package remains outside the changed-file set.
- manifest/schema validation: `NOT_APPLICABLE` — neither machine artifact is changed and no JSON payload is introduced by this PR.

### Component/integration

- command/run: `NOT_APPLICABLE` — paper-only evidence/task records; no machine contract or runtime component changed.
- result: `NOT_APPLICABLE`

### E2E

- scenario: `NOT_APPLICABLE` — no executable behavior or runtime authority.
- result: `NOT_APPLICABLE`

### Exact-head CI

- final head: recorded externally on PR #271 after the repair commit exists; a commit cannot contain its own SHA
- trigger source: draft PR
- workflow/run/job: external PR/check evidence
- runner assignment: external PR/check evidence
- classification: governance/documentation gates only
- result: external PR/check evidence

## Self-review

- exact head: recorded externally on PR #271 after the repair commit exists
- method/reviewer: DOMAIN ARCHITECTURE DESIGN AGENT / Agent A worker
- material findings: five bookkeeping/ownership/scope/evidence-integrity findings above repaired; exact repaired-head full diff must be inspected before PR handoff
- verdict: **PENDING EXACT-HEAD FULL-DIFF SELF-REVIEW**, then coordinator re-audit

## Independent review

- required: YES — issue #259 explicitly requires coordinator audit
- exact head: coordinator must pin the repaired PR #271 head
- method/auditor: architecture coordinator
- material findings: locator-integrity finding returned for repair; fresh repaired-head audit pending
- verdict: pending coordinator re-audit

## PR and closeout

- draft PR: #271
- changed-file review: expected exactly the two Agent A-owned files; exact repaired-head file set must be rechecked externally before handoff
- unresolved review threads: locator-integrity thread exists from the coordinator/audit cycle and must be rechecked after repair; worker does not substitute its self-review for coordinator disposition
- related/superseded PRs: PR #255 is accepted predecessor evidence package
- protected auto-merge: FORBIDDEN BY ISSUE #259 / user instruction
- merge commit/result: NOT PERFORMED
- issue #259 close: NOT PERFORMED
- ownership release: NOT PERFORMED; task remains in `active/` for coordinator audit
- lifecycle closeout: NOT PERFORMED / FORBIDDEN FOR THIS WORKER
