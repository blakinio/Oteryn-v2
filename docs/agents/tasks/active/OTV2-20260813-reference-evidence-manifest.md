## Outcome

Create the canonical paper-only contract and initial machine-readable registry
for the accepted immutable 2026-07-28 first Reference target, without promoting
unsupported mechanics or authorizing runtime work.

## Architecture and source of truth

- **PROVEN:** the accepted first target is Global Tibia production-observable
  behavior after the 2026-07-28 server-save/maintenance boundary.
- **PROVEN:** the accepted baseline requires a versioned evidence manifest and
  separates target evidence from Oteryn implementation/test parity.
- **PROVEN:** current programme status selects this manifest as the one next
  paper-only action.
- **UNKNOWN:** no mechanic-level case is complete in the initial registry;
  domain coverage therefore remains explicitly empty/fail-closed.
- **CONFLICT:** none introduced by this task. Historical pre-decision evidence
  remains non-authoritative; open PR #191 owns its bounded provenance correction.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Freeze the accepted target without inventing a later Reference revision.
- [x] Define evidence, implementation and parity axes independently.
- [x] Define source hierarchy, provenance, historical continuity and conflicts.
- [x] Add a parseable machine-readable initial manifest with no unsupported
      `PARITY_CONFIRMED` cases.
- [x] Define deterministic future identity via RFC 8785 JCS + SHA-256 without
      hand-claiming a digest before tooling exists.
- [x] Preserve security/integrity/legal overrides and OTS non-authority.
- [ ] Inspect the full changed-file diff.
- [ ] Run applicable governance/document checks on the exact final head.
- [ ] Complete exact-head self-review and required review classification.
- [ ] Confirm zero unresolved material review threads.
- [ ] Squash merge unchanged accepted head and archive/release ownership.

## Excluded scope

No runtime, client, server, protocol, persistence, content compiler/loader,
database schema/migration, evidence-capture automation, official-client
automation, Platform/external-repository write, proprietary material,
production behavior, entitlement activation or new stable architecture gate.

## Implementation / findings

Issue #219 owns this package. Initial registry revision 1 intentionally contains
an empty mechanic-case array plus explicit domain coverage gaps. This is
preferable to importing pre-decision evidence as accepted truth.

The manifest digest remains `null` with an explicit meaning until accepted
tooling canonicalizes and verifies it. This task does not add a dependency or
claim executable digest validation.

## Validation

### Focused

- command/run: JSON generated and parsed with native JavaScript `JSON.parse`
  before connector write
- result: PASS

### Component/integration

- command/run: NOT_APPLICABLE — paper-only contract/manifest; no executable
  component changed
- result: NOT_APPLICABLE

### E2E

- scenario: NOT_APPLICABLE — no runtime or user-visible executable behavior
- result: NOT_APPLICABLE

### Exact-head CI

- final head: pending after task record/PR metadata freeze
- trigger source: pull request
- workflow/run/job: pending
- runner assignment: pending
- classification: pending
- result: pending

## Self-review

- exact head: pending
- method/reviewer: implementing/coordinating agent
- material findings: pending
- verdict: pending

## Independent review

- required: pending final risk classification
- exact head: pending
- method/auditor: pending
- material findings: pending
- verdict: pending
- owner-funded Codex/OpenAI usage: FORBIDDEN / NOT INVOKED

## PR and closeout

- changed-file review: pending
- unresolved review threads: pending
- related/superseded PRs: #162 and #191 inspected as non-overlapping; #191
  provenance correction must not be absorbed
- protected auto-merge: pending
- merge commit/result: pending
- ownership release: pending
