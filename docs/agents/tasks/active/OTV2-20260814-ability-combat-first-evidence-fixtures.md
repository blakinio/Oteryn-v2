## Outcome

Register the first bounded representative `ABILITY_COMBAT` target-case shapes for Light Healing and Ice Strike, plus non-executable pending fixture blueprints, while proving that indexed post-boundary official content cannot be promoted into the immutable 2026-07-28 target without continuity evidence.

## Architecture and source of truth

- **PROVEN:** `main@996da4270beadc548781fb81e95ea342e84b6376` has accepted/pinned/lifecycle-closed Reference manifest v1 revision 2 with `cases=[]` and `ABILITY_COMBAT=NO_MECHANIC_CASES_REGISTERED`.
- **PROVEN:** `REFERENCE_EVIDENCE_PARITY_MANIFEST_CONTRACT.md` requires post-target observations to remain `UNKNOWN` for the immutable target unless admissible continuity evidence bridges the target cut; patch-note/search absence is not continuity evidence.
- **PROVEN:** GAME-ABILITY partial baselines require typed targeting/legality, explicit commit/cost/cooldown anchors, distinct healing/damage semantics and catalogue-local evidence/fixture bindings.
- **INDEXED OFFICIAL DISCOVERY EVIDENCE:** exact official Tibia Library locators for Light Healing and Ice Strike were surfaced through search on 2026-08-14. The search index reported an approximately two-week-old crawl; direct page opens from the research environment returned HTTP 403 and exact crawl time is unavailable.
- **UNKNOWN FOR TARGET:** continuity of every surfaced field/description to the 2026-07-28 cut, equality with the live page at retrieval time, plus exact heal magnitude, damage formula, exact range, complete legality, mitigation/resistance and RNG semantics.
- **PROVEN:** Oteryn GAME-ABILITY runtime implementation remains `NOT_STARTED`; no passing parity fixture is available.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Evidence capture contains only bounded paraphrased official-public indexed content, exact official locators, retrieval limitations and explicit continuity uncertainty; no proprietary assets/code.
- [x] Manifest increments to revision 3, changes only `ABILITY_COMBAT` inventory plus bounded cases/history, and preserves the immutable target/policy/normative-contract envelope.
- [x] Every new target case is `UNKNOWN`, Oteryn `NOT_STARTED`, parity `PARITY_PENDING_EVIDENCE`, with legal review `PENDING`, no exact Oteryn revision and no fixture/test link.
- [x] Manifest source retrieval timestamps use RFC3339 UTC; exact crawl/live observation time remains null/unknown rather than invented.
- [x] No case claims target-cut or verified-live heal/damage metadata, magnitude, exact range, complete legality, resistance or RNG behavior.
- [x] Human-readable package separates indexed official content from live-page truth and immutable-target truth, and defines pending fixture blueprints without calling them passing/executable parity fixtures.
- [x] `FOUNDATION_PROGRAMME_CURRENT_STATUS.md` remains untouched in delivery because its currently selected action is this active package; lifecycle closeout will advance the canonical next action to target-continuity evidence.
- [ ] Complete final exact-head full-diff self-review, repository validation and lifecycle closeout.

## Excluded scope

No target classification above `UNKNOWN`; no verified-live-page claim; no runtime/client/protocol implementation; no physical catalogue schema/serializer/runner; no exact combat formulas or RNG; no DDL/Platform/production/external-repository writes; no new stable gate ID; no Codex/OpenAI/owner-funded AI use without separate exact authorization.

## Implementation / findings

Issue #254 / draft PR #255 own this bounded evidence package. Light Healing exercises the healing/self catalogue shape and Ice Strike the targeted attack/damage shape, but no immutable-target behavior is asserted from indexed current-state-near content alone.

**Material self-review finding 1 — repaired:** the initial package incorrectly classified post-boundary official content as target `OBSERVED`. Owning manifest continuity policy requires `UNKNOWN` without continuity evidence. Evidence, manifest, catalogue and issue/PR metadata were repaired accordingly.

**Material self-review finding 2 — repaired:** the evidence artifact initially described the source too strongly as a retrieved current/live page. Re-verification showed the research tool surfaces indexed content for the exact official locators, reports an approximately two-week-old crawl, and receives HTTP 403 on direct page open. Evidence, manifest, catalogue and metadata now record that retrieval mode explicitly; exact crawl/live observation time is not invented.

The repairs make the recommended next evidence action precise: prove the target-continuity path for these four representative cases before broadening mechanic inventory or freezing physical catalogue tooling.

## Validation

### Focused

- manifest JSON construction/parse: **PASS**.
- accepted schema v1 manual shape audit: **PASS** — revision/status/domain/case/source/provenance/history shapes conform; `UNKNOWN` correctly implies `PARITY_PENDING_EVIDENCE`; null exact revisions and empty fixture links are permitted; `PENDING` legal review is permitted; source retrieval timestamp is RFC3339 date-time.
- fail-closed invariant audit: **PASS** — 4 unique cases; all target `UNKNOWN`; all Oteryn `NOT_STARTED`; all parity `PARITY_PENDING_EVIDENCE`; all exact revisions null; all fixture/test links empty; all legal-review states `PENDING`; no case-level `OBSERVED` and no `PARITY_CONFIRMED`.
- inventory audit: **PASS** — only `ABILITY_COMBAT` changes to `MECHANIC_CASES_REGISTERED`; other domain coverage remains unchanged.
- continuity policy audit: **PASS after repair 1** — indexed post-boundary content is discovery evidence only and cannot promote target evidence.
- source provenance audit: **PASS after repair 2** — exact official locators retained; search-index crawl freshness/direct-fetch 403 recorded; exact crawl/live time left unknown; retrieval timestamp is the verified research retrieval time `2026-08-14T11:01:22Z`.
- official indexed field readback: **PASS** for the bounded surfaced Light Healing and Ice Strike metadata/qualitative descriptions; no broader behavior inferred.

### Component/integration

### E2E

- scenario: `NOT_APPLICABLE` — no executable gameplay behavior.
- result: `NOT_APPLICABLE`.

### Exact-head CI

## Self-review

- superseded semantic content head: `77d30e341d490b8670560373ebc52a87aed6bebe`.
- method/reviewer: implementing/coordinating architecture continuation agent.
- material findings: 2 evidence classification/provenance findings; both repaired across the affected evidence/manifest/catalogue/metadata layers.
- verdict: pending final resulting-head full-diff recheck.

## Independent review

- required: NO unless a later material finding/risk expansion changes classification; this is paper-only public-evidence registration with no executable/security/durable-value authority.
- exact head: NOT_APPLICABLE.
- method/auditor: NOT_APPLICABLE.
- material findings: NOT_APPLICABLE.
- verdict: NOT_APPLICABLE.
- owner-funded AI: **NOT AUTHORIZED** for PR #255; prior authorizations do not carry forward.

## PR and closeout

- PR: #255 (draft).
- changed-file review: pending final resulting-head recheck; intended paths = 4.
- unresolved review threads: pending readback.
- related/superseded PRs: #239/#240 Dependabot and #191 GAME-CHAR are disjoint.
- protected auto-merge: pending.
- merge commit/result: pending.
- ownership release: pending.
