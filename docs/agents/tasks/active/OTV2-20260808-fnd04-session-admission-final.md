## Outcome

Deliver the complete architecture-only FND-04 contract needed before native identity/admission/reconnect/lease implementation can be designed without guessing security or authority semantics.

Acceptance completes the FND-04 architecture gate only. It does not authorize runtime, Platform, persistence, protocol codec, key or production implementation.

## Architecture and source of truth

- **PROVEN:** FND-04 analysis baseline plus Platform reconciliation refinement are canonical on `main` after #104/#107 and closeout #108.
- **PROVEN:** duplicate/superseded PR #106 is closed unmerged and contributes no separate authority.
- **PROVEN:** current external Platform evidence is pinned read-only at `216f5b2817e9d102337608609e344518512c2a0d`.
- **PROVEN:** Platform Identity/Gateway authorizes bounded attempts; Oteryn-v2 remains final admission/GameSession/CharacterLease authority.
- **PROVEN:** FND-02 fixes TLS/bootstrap, GameSessionId issuance boundary, connection_generation and command/reconciliation semantics.
- **PROVEN:** FND-03 fixes runtime owner/fencing/time semantics and executes accepted 2s/5s/4s effects after FND-04 classifications.
- **PROVEN current standard:** RFC 9864 registers fully specified JOSE `Ed25519` and deprecates polymorphic `EdDSA`; both FND-04 grant profiles use exact `alg=Ed25519` and reject `EdDSA` fallback.
- **DERIVED AND FROZEN BY CANDIDATE:** fresh entry and reauthenticated existing-actor recovery use mutually exclusive signed profiles so Channel-bound fresh-entry authority cannot be reused to move a current actor.
- **DERIVED AND FROZEN BY CANDIDATE:** reconnect uses a two-phase PREPARE/COMMIT transition; COMMIT revalidates current incumbent/session/lease/runtime/reconciliation eligibility and proof-class security state before any authority switch.
- **DERIVED AND FROZEN BY CANDIDATE:** Platform account-security validity is bounded by signed generation + <=5-second trusted security-projection freshness for new admission/recovery; this does not grant Platform post-admission gameplay mutation authority.
- **DERIVED AND FROZEN BY CANDIDATE:** the normative FND-04 refinement now records mandatory decision timing plus full retry/terminal/idempotency/public progression for every contract-owned cross-component failure code.
- **DEFERRED BY EVIDENCE:** production liveness probe cadence/anti-flap hysteresis and CharacterLease TTL/renew/safety-margin values require measured fault/performance evidence before implementation acceptance.

## Acceptance criteria

### Authority and lifecycle

- [x] Freeze AccountPresenceClaim, CharacterLease, GameSession, TransportBinding and RuntimeScopeAuthority relationship.
- [x] Freeze fresh admission linearization and no-partial-authority rule.
- [x] Freeze duplicate-login / healthy-incumbent / intentional-takeover semantics.
- [x] Freeze GameSession terminality versus mandatory actor presence and same-character post-grace fresh-session attachment.
- [x] Freeze Channel↔Instance continuous-session and Channel↔Channel fresh-session continuity classes.

### Admission / recovery security profiles

- [x] Freeze exact v1 JWS Compact JWT profiles using fully specified JOSE `alg=Ed25519`, independent from application library/vendor.
- [x] Freeze exact protected-header allowlists, explicit `typ`, issuer/audience/purpose, required claims, parser/size limits and rejection of token-directed key discovery.
- [x] Enforce FND-ID UUIDv7 + RFC-variant semantics for AdmissionAttemptRef, CharacterId, WorldId and ChannelId claims while preserving Platform-owned AccountId representation.
- [x] Freeze fresh-entry and recovery validators as mutually exclusive credential purposes.
- [x] Freeze AdmissionAttemptRef versus GrantNonce/RecoveryGrantNonce semantics and bounded replay/idempotency retention.
- [x] Freeze post-issuance Platform account-security generation/revocation freshness semantics.
- [x] Freeze fresh-entry route/runtime observation/ownership-generation binding and default stale-grant invalidation after owner-generation change.
- [x] Freeze key-purpose separation, rotation/emergency revocation and no-downgrade behavior.

### Reconnect / liveness

- [x] Freeze 32-byte game-domain reconnect secret properties.
- [x] Freeze reconnect PREPARE/COMMIT state machine, successor proof and lost-response/crash reconciliation.
- [x] Require atomic COMMIT-time revalidation so a prepared successor cannot preempt a recovered healthy incumbent or outlive session/lease/runtime/recovery-security eligibility.
- [x] Freeze one-winner connection_generation transition semantics.
- [x] Freeze exact 15-second same-session grace from the accepted 2-second loss declaration; keep 5-second transport cleanup independent.
- [x] Freeze actor/session ControlLossEpoch so routine rebind/session replacement cannot manufacture duplicate 4-second protection.
- [x] Freeze Platform-reauthenticated same-session recovery and current game-domain placement resolution.
- [x] Freeze post-grace same-character fresh GameSession attachment to the exact existing `PRESENT_UNCONTROLLED` actor without reset/recreation.
- [x] Define measured liveness cadence/hysteresis evidence gate instead of guessing production values.
- [x] Define measured CharacterLease TTL/renew/safety-margin evidence gate instead of guessing production values.

### Failure, compatibility and progression

- [x] Add stable `FS-ADMISSION-GRANT-REPLAY` and `FS-RECONNECT-CREDENTIAL-REPLAY` scenarios.
- [x] Freeze stable internal symbolic error codes and safe public presentation classes without leaking security/fencing details.
- [x] Freeze `RETRYABLE` / `TERMINAL` / `SECURITY_TERMINAL`, exact retry authority and mutation/idempotency outcome for every FND-04 cross-component error code.
- [x] Freeze producer/consumer compatibility matrix and independent fixture requirements.
- [x] Record mandatory decision timing, blocked downstream work and evidence required to supersede each material FND-04 choice.
- [x] Synchronize `FOUNDATION_PROGRAMME_CURRENT_STATUS.md` through FND-03 completion, repaired FND-04 analysis and current final FND-04 delivery.

### Governance

- [x] No open PR existed at final-task start after duplicate #106 was closed.
- [x] No Rust/runtime/protocol codec/persistence schema/Platform write/key deployment/production activation introduced by this package.
- [x] Initial PR #109 metadata governance failure was diagnosed as title length `77 > 72`; PR title was shortened to `docs: finalize FND-04 session admission and lease contract` before final-head validation.
- [x] Declared task ownership now matches the PR's exact seven documentation paths.
- [ ] Full exact-head seven-path architecture/security review has zero material conflicts.
- [ ] Exact-head Agent governance, Dependency review and CodeQL pass.
- [ ] Independent exact-head architecture/security audit passes with zero open material findings.
- [ ] Zero unresolved review threads.
- [ ] Squash merge only after final-head gates; archive/release ownership separately.

## Excluded scope

This task does not implement or authorize Oteryn-v2 GameSession/admission/reconnect/lease Rust code; protocol listener/codec/schema registration; PostgreSQL/Redis schema; Platform/Gateway code; recovery-locator code; KMS/HSM/vendor/library selection; production keys; production liveness/lease values; deployment or live traffic.

## Implementation / findings

### Final authority model

```text
AccountPresenceClaim -> AccountId-global one playable/mandatory-presence CharacterId
CharacterLease -> CharacterId writer/control fence + generation
GameSession -> one logical player-control lifecycle
TransportBinding -> GameSessionId + current connection_generation
RuntimeScopeAuthority -> current FND-03 ChannelRuntime/InstanceRuntime owner generation
```

### Signed Platform capabilities

Fresh entry uses `oteryn-pre-admission-v1`; reauthenticated recovery uses `oteryn-reauth-recovery-v1`. Both are strict JWS Compact JWT profiles with fully specified `alg=Ed25519`, 30-second maximum token lifetime, 5-second verifier skew, <=5-second current Platform-security evidence and explicit replay/idempotency state. CharacterId/WorldId/ChannelId and producer attempt references enforce their accepted UUIDv7/RFC-variant semantics.

### Reconnect ambiguity and stale-authority elimination

Reconnect PREPARE reserves one candidate generation/successor secret but grants no transport authority. COMMIT after successor proof revalidates current GameSession, predecessor generation/liveness, AccountPresenceClaim, CharacterLease, runtime ownership/placement and reconciliation state. Recovery-grant PREPARE additionally requires the JWT, RecoveryGrantNonce and current Platform-security validity to remain acceptable through COMMIT. Only then does one atomic transition change connection_generation/current transport/current reconnect verifier and fence predecessor.

### Grace / recovery

```text
T0 last sufficient control
T0+2s control loss declared
T0+5s stale concrete transport cleanup
loss declaration + 15s same-session grace expiry
```

Protection is one activation per eligible ControlLossEpoch. Post-grace mandatory actor becomes `PRESENT_UNCONTROLLED`; same-character reauthenticated recovery may create a new GameSession attached to the same actor, never respawn/reset it. Different CharacterId remains blocked until legal actor absence.

### Review repair disposition

The final-package repair closes the material review classes observed on prior heads:

- UUIDv7/version/variant validation is explicit in both grant profiles;
- the normative refinement records mandatory architecture decision timing;
- PREPARE no longer acts as authorization escrow: COMMIT revalidates current authority and proof-class security before switching control;
- every contract-owned error now has one foundation category, disposition, retry-authority rule, mutation/idempotency outcome and bounded public class.

## Validation

### Focused

- accepted-input reconciliation: complete pending exact-head seven-path diff audit;
- standards review: RFC 9864 fully specified `Ed25519`; deprecated `EdDSA` explicit negative fixture;
- profile separation/UUID/replay/route/security-freshness/reconnect/lease/liveness/error-progression review: repaired; pending fresh independent exact-head audit.

### Component/integration

- `NOT_APPLICABLE` — architecture contract delivery only.

### E2E

- `NOT_APPLICABLE` for this documentation delivery. Future implementation evidence is explicitly defined by the profiles/contract/refinement.

### Exact-head CI

- historical pre-repair head `4bb02e5b211cd791b88610d540c80b0ce14e4126`: Dependency review `PASS`, CodeQL `PASS`, Agent governance `FAIL` only because original PR title exceeded 72 characters; historical and not reusable as final evidence.
- historical reviewed head `6ea04ac8cd7587e3416160de2ad0639cf8415745`: CI green, but later material Codex findings invalidate terminal readiness.
- post-review repair generation: pending exact-head checks after the final task-sync commit.
- trigger source: `pull_request:synchronize`
- result: pending

## Independent audit

- exact final head: pending
- verdict: pending; the prior PASS cannot be terminal evidence because later material review findings were opened on the reviewed generation.

## PR and closeout

- final delivery PR: 109
- current title: `docs: finalize FND-04 session admission and lease contract`
- changed-file review: expected exactly seven owned documentation paths
- unresolved review threads: pending repair reconciliation/fresh review
- merge policy: squash after exact-head validation
- ownership release: separate lifecycle closeout after delivery merge

## Context checkpoint
