## Outcome

Persist the owner's explicit acceptance that **Reference gameplay mechanics follow the selected named Global Tibia parity baseline**, including solo/party, PvP, progression, death and risk semantics, while `GAME-VISION-01` defines the long-term Oteryn/Evolved product direction and shared cross-profile quality bar rather than silently overriding Reference.

The owner also accepted the progression/death/risk direction: Reference keeps the selected baseline rules; the first Evolved package does not automatically redesign them; any Oteryn-specific progression/death/risk redesign requires a later explicit, versioned and measurable Evolved gate.

## Architecture and source of truth

- `USER_SOURCE`: on 2026-08-11 the owner explicitly accepted the recommended progression/death/risk direction and clarified that solo/party and PvP should be reproduced from Global Tibia in Reference, asking whether Vision describes how the target Oteryn game should eventually look.
- `PROVEN`: Reference-first and hybrid tracking already require named immutable Reference revisions and explicit promotion of upstream changes.
- `PROVEN`: player-promise and shared architecture decisions impose reliability, server-authority and explicit-difference requirements across profiles.
- `PROVEN`: the existing PvP-secondary and solo-viable/party-rewarded baselines already state that actual Reference mechanics remain governed by the named parity baseline; therefore no historical baseline rewrite is required.
- `DERIVED`: the new canonical precedence baseline centralizes the owner's clarification and prevents future-facing gameplay preferences from being misread as Reference overrides.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Record that Reference gameplay mechanics follow the selected named Global Tibia baseline unless an explicit documented Reference difference is separately accepted.
- [x] Explicitly include solo/party, PvP, progression, death and risk in that precedence rule.
- [x] Record that `PvP = secondary pillar` is product-direction guidance and does not authorize changing Reference PvP semantics or importance away from the selected baseline.
- [x] Record that `solo viable, party rewarded` is product-direction guidance and does not authorize changing Reference party/shared-XP/content semantics away from the selected baseline.
- [x] Record the accepted progression/death/risk direction: Reference is the launch oracle; first Evolved does not automatically redesign it; later redesign requires an isolated explicit Evolved gate.
- [x] Distinguish long-term Evolved gameplay direction from cross-profile quality/authority rules that apply to both Reference and Evolved.
- [x] Keep exact Reference patch/date/revision selection unresolved.
- [x] Keep exact death/progression formulas, blessings, loss rates and Evolved redesign unresolved.
- [x] Keep full `GAME-VISION-01` explicitly `NOT ACCEPTED` unless remaining required decisions are separately closed/deferred.
- [x] No runtime/client/server/content/production implementation is authorized.
- [ ] Exact-head self-review and repository-required CI pass before merge.

## Excluded scope

This task must not:

- implement or change gameplay/runtime behavior;
- select the exact Global Tibia patch/date/revision used by Reference;
- change Reference mechanics away from the selected baseline;
- define XP/skill loss, blessings, death penalties, PvP formulas, shared-XP formulas, party bonuses or content requirements;
- redefine channel/PvP switching policy;
- freeze a concrete Evolved progression/death redesign;
- rewrite historical owner baselines where their existing Reference boundary is already correct;
- change public branding/marketing claims;
- modify parallel draft PR #162 repository-engineering/governance paths;
- authorize production rollout.

## Implementation / findings

- Main at task start: `5b141e009f929226a59c2f13cd5075f20a2aeea6`.
- Open PR at task start: draft #162 (`ci: enforce aggregate pull request merge gate`), owning disjoint repository-engineering/governance paths.
- Active tasks at task start: foundation preimplementation contracts plus two disconnect-analysis tasks; no path overlap with this bounded GAME-VISION delivery.
- Added `docs/architecture/GAME-VISION-01_REFERENCE_PARITY_PRECEDENCE_OWNER_BASELINE.md` as the canonical precedence/interpretation record.
- Re-read the existing PvP and solo/party owner baselines. Both already preserve named Reference parity for actual mechanics, so this task intentionally avoids unnecessary edits to historical accepted baselines and instead centralizes the new owner clarification in the dedicated precedence document.

## Validation

### Focused

- command/run: compare current owner clarification against Reference-first/hybrid/player-promise/PvP/solo-party baselines, `GAME-VISION-01_PREDECISION_ANALYSIS.md` item 8 and ADR-0010; verify no parallel ownership collision
- result: **PASS** for declared owner scope before PR/final-head freeze; exact-head review still required after PR checkpoint

### Component/integration

- command/run: `NOT_APPLICABLE` — architecture/task documentation only; no executable behavior changes
- result: `NOT_APPLICABLE`

### E2E

- scenario: `NOT_APPLICABLE` — no runtime/client/server/content behavior changes
- result: `NOT_APPLICABLE`

### Exact-head CI

- final head: pending PR checkpoint
- trigger source: pending
- workflow/run/job: pending
- runner assignment: pending
- classification: repository-required documentation checks
- result: pending

## Audit

- scope: owner-source fidelity, Reference-vs-Evolved authority, accidental parity override, accidental detailed gameplay freeze, cross-profile quality interpretation, task-template completeness and parallel ownership collision
- material findings: no material finding in focused pre-freeze review; exact-head audit pending
- unresolved findings: pending
- verdict: pending

## Self-review

- exact head: pending
- method/reviewer: implementing/coordinating agent full-diff product/architecture/governance review
- material findings: pending
- verdict: pending

## Independent review

- required: `NO` under current risk policy — bounded product/architecture documentation; no executable security/protocol/persistence/production/multichannel-authority semantics are changed
- exact head: `NOT_APPLICABLE`
- method/auditor: `NOT_APPLICABLE`
- material findings: `NOT_APPLICABLE`
- verdict: `NOT_APPLICABLE`

## PR and closeout

- changed-file review: pending exact final head
- unresolved review threads: pending
- related/superseded PRs: parallel disjoint draft PR #162; no supersession
- protected auto-merge: pending
- merge commit/result: pending
- ownership release: pending lifecycle archive after merge
