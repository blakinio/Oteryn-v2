## Outcome

Delivered the nonbinding minimum GAME-CHAR Stage-B closure owner-decision packet:

- `docs/architecture/GAME-CHAR-01_STAGE_B_MINIMUM_CLOSURE_DECISION_PACKET.md`.

The packet remains **PRE-DECISION SYNTHESIS / NOT ACCEPTED**. It converts the lifecycle-closed #183/#185/#187 evidence into a bounded recommendation for accepting GAME-CHAR semantic architecture while preserving every unresolved Reference value/formula/profile detail as a fail-closed downstream parity gate.

No Stage-B or overall GAME-CHAR decision was accepted by this task.

## Source of truth

- `PROVEN`: first Reference target is owner-accepted as Global Tibia production-observable behavior after the 2026-07-28 server-save/maintenance boundary.
- `PROVEN`: GAME-CHAR Stage A is owner-accepted.
- `PROVEN`: #183/#185/#187 are lifecycle-closed nonbinding evidence packages.
- `PROVEN`: exact first Reference PvP/world profile remains unresolved.
- `PROVEN`: therefore a closure cannot claim one Character schema complete for every future world/PvP profile.
- `PROVEN`: PR #162 remained disjoint and untouched.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Defined minimum semantic Stage-B closure sufficient for durable Character architecture without pretending unresolved formulas/values are known.
- [x] Classified unresolved items between semantic architecture and versioned Reference policy/ruleset/SIM/content/world-profile parity gates.
- [x] Preserved fail-closed parity: unresolved values/formulas cannot be implemented/claimed until evidenced or explicitly declared different.
- [x] Preserved Stage-A/FND-ID/FND-04, Platform entitlement, GAME-ITEM/DUR-03, world/profile/PvP and content/ruleset boundaries.
- [x] Added explicit Reference vocabulary for five vocation families/promoted forms, pre-vocation state and eight target-observed skill categories.
- [x] Constrained recommended DUR-02 effect to profile-neutral core Character schema architecture plus typed/versioned extension/migration boundaries.
- [x] Prohibited an untyped/generic miscellaneous-state bag as a substitute for later semantic ownership decisions.
- [x] Added explicit supersession/reopening evidence rule.
- [x] Did not update current status/register/horizon because no owner acceptance exists.
- [x] Did not implement runtime/schema/protocol/content/Platform behavior.
- [x] Full exact-head self-review and required documentation CI passed before merge.

## Recommended owner package — still not accepted

The packet recommends accepting these eleven semantic decisions:

1. global logical Character Authority name namespace plus versioned canonical-comparison policy; exact normalization/recycling remains parity-pending;
2. Stage-A lifecycle retained, active-character quota `25` accepted as Reference policy, while unresolved deletion/name-hold values remain versioned parity-pending policy;
3. creation uses versioned ruleset/content/starter context, exact starter content stays content/parity-owned, and pre-vocation state must be representable;
4. first Reference semantic vocabulary includes five vocation families/promoted forms plus pre-vocation state and eight evidenced skill categories;
5. progression ownership/catalogue closes independently from exact formulas when durability stays formula-neutral and versioned;
6. promotion achievement is Character-owned while active benefits may consume Platform-owned entitlement/ruleset state; unresolved fee/lapse edges remain parity-pending;
7. death/protection is profile-scoped, so generic Character durability does not require exhaustive PvP edges before world-profile selection;
8. offline-training counter/capability is Character-owned with evidenced 10-minute / 12-hour / 1:1 timer-pool semantics, while effectiveness remains ruleset/SIM-pending;
9. modern character-specific progression belongs to Character domain scope but may use child aggregates; definition/item/economy/Platform authorities remain separate;
10. every remaining `UNKNOWN/CONFLICT` is an explicit hard parity gate and never an implementation default;
11. GAME-CHAR architecture scope is semantic ownership/versioning/migration; exact arithmetic remains mandatory before Reference implementation/parity claim when it does not constrain durable topology.

If the owner later accepts this package through a separate owner-baseline delivery lifecycle, the recommendation is:

```text
GAME-CHAR-01
DecisionStatus       = ACCEPTED
DeliveryStatus       = LIFECYCLE_CLOSED after owner-baseline closeout
ImplementationStatus = NOT_STARTED
Runtime authority    = NONE
```

and `DUR-02` may proceed to final paper-only **profile-neutral core** Character schema architecture with explicit typed/versioned profile-extension and migration boundaries. Profile-specific durable Character facts remain separately gated before that profile's schema may be called complete.

## Review repairs

### Repair cycle 1 — semantic catalogue omission

Finding:

- initial closure packet did not explicitly freeze target-observed vocation/skill vocabulary needed by durability.

Repair:

- added Druid/Elder Druid, Knight/Elite Knight, Monk/Exalted Monk, Paladin/Royal Paladin, Sorcerer/Master Sorcerer;
- added explicit pre-vocation/unselected state;
- added Fist, Club, Sword, Axe, Distance, Shielding, Fishing and Magic Level;
- retained these as versioned Reference ruleset definitions, not universal engine/protocol enums;
- added supersession/reopening evidence rules.

### Repair cycle 2 — all-profile schema completeness overclaim

Finding:

- initial post-acceptance effect said DUR-02 could proceed to a final Character schema while first Reference PvP/world profile remains unresolved.

Repair:

- narrowed effect to a final paper-only **profile-neutral core** Character schema architecture;
- required typed/versioned profile extension and migration boundaries;
- kept profile-specific durable facts separately gated;
- prohibited an untyped/generic miscellaneous-state bag;
- required future profile-specific extensions to preserve Stage-A fencing, explicit ownership and migration/rollback policy.

Repair budget used: `2/3`.

## Validation

### Focused reconciliation

Result: **PASS after repair cycle 2** against:

- Stage A owner baseline;
- accepted first Reference target/evidence hierarchy;
- #183/#185/#187 evidence;
- PvP secondary-pillar boundary;
- architecture status model;
- architecture decision discipline.

The final packet preserves strict Reference parity while separating profile-neutral durable topology from later arithmetic/policy/profile evidence.

### Mandatory exact-head self-review

- exact delivery head: `7d2097e9ab68f6410c4280e4941e073309334807`;
- PR review id: `4911098893`;
- reviewer: implementing/coordinating agent, explicitly **not independent**;
- final material findings: `0`;
- verdict: **PASS**.

### Exact-head CI

Final delivery head `7d2097e9ab68f6410c4280e4941e073309334807`:

- Agent Governance `31540201827` / generation #867 — **success**;
- Dependency Review `31540201832` / generation #621 — **success**;
- CodeQL `31540201942` / generation #755 — **success**.

### Component/integration/runtime E2E

`NOT_APPLICABLE` — nonbinding paper-only decision synthesis; no executable/player-visible behavior changed.

### Independent review

- required: `NO` under trusted-base risk policy;
- reason: nonbinding pre-decision synthesis with no executable security/protocol/persistence/production authority change and zero final material findings.

## Delivery PR and boundaries

- delivery PR: #190;
- final changed files: exactly two declared documentation paths;
- unresolved review threads at merge: `0`;
- branch behind main at merge: `0`;
- squash merge: `02887e94dff9ddb5e5e11f1c11c99f03fff51879`;
- no current status/register/horizon changes;
- no runtime/schema/protocol/content/Platform/production authority;
- external repositories untouched;
- PR #162 untouched.

## Downstream consequence

The next action is an owner decision, not further generic evidence acquisition.

Until explicit owner acceptance:

```text
GAME-CHAR-01
DecisionStatus       = PROPOSED
DeliveryStatus       = PLANNED
ImplementationStatus = NOT_STARTED
Runtime authority    = NONE
```

The packet's recommended profile-neutral DUR-02 core remains blocked on that owner decision. Unknown/Conflict target behavior remains separately fail-closed regardless of whether semantic architecture is later accepted.
