## Outcome

The second-pass ecosystem repository-topology review was delivered by PR #280 and squash merge `a01937b0db497e82e946fea2fddd46ec7958339e`.

Canonical review document:

`docs/architecture/reviews/OTERYN_ECOSYSTEM_REPOSITORY_TOPOLOGY_SENIOR_DEV_PM_SECOND_PASS_2026-08-15.md`

Verdict: **first-pass `ACCEPT_WITH_CHANGES` upheld with stronger delivery constraints**.

The second pass retains `Oteryn-Game` as the correct high-cohesion repository for Client + Server + `protocol-oteryn` + shared domain + canonical World/Content + compiler/validation/bundles + bounded legacy import + Studio, while adding stronger requirements for demand-driven physical repository operations, independent release units, path/dependency-aware CI, heavy-asset storage separation, consumer-proven Atlas compatibility and measured future extraction triggers.

No repository reorganization, runtime implementation, external repository write, CI/CD change or production change was performed.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Verified current `main`, governance, active tasks, open PR state and the merged first-pass review.
- [x] Re-evaluated Client/Server/Protocol/World/Studio co-location from senior developer/programmer/maintainer perspectives.
- [x] Re-evaluated META creation timing from project-management/producer perspective.
- [x] Re-evaluated Game->Atlas producer/consumer contract and compatibility evidence.
- [x] Defined explicit evidence-based future extraction triggers for Client, Protocol, Studio, Content and services.
- [x] Defined migration waves that avoid making repository reorganization the default critical path ahead of native product evidence.
- [x] Assessed CI, release units, large asset/content storage, CODEOWNERS, path ownership and maintainability/bus-factor concerns.
- [x] Persisted exact deltas versus the first-pass review without modifying or superseding it.
- [x] Completed exact-head full-diff self-review with zero open material findings.
- [x] Completed required exact-head repository validation.
- [x] Squash-merged delivery PR #280 and verified the merge on `main`.
- [ ] Complete bookkeeping-only lifecycle closeout through the archive PR.

## Excluded scope

- No repository rename/create/delete/transfer or code movement.
- No Git submodules, monorepo conversion or dependency migration.
- No runtime/client/server/protocol/world/compiler/Studio/Atlas implementation.
- No Platform, Atlas, Otheryn or otclient writes.
- No CI/CD, deployment, database, secret or production mutation.
- No accepted ADR/contract or first-pass review supersession.

## Validation

### Focused

- delivery base: `main@dcc4a7773a48ea07720ae3f19f090bcfee2d266b`;
- exact final delivery head: `55193e83ddb6c6e440532a58990eef6c34fde383`;
- delivery diff: exactly two declared documentation paths, `behind_by=0`: **PASS**;
- exact-head self-review: PR review `4943816020`, zero open material findings: **PASS**;
- unresolved review threads before merge: `0`: **PASS**;
- delivery merge: `a01937b0db497e82e946fea2fddd46ec7958339e`: **PASS**.

### Component / integration / E2E

`NOT_APPLICABLE` — documentation-only architecture audit/recommendation; no executable/public machine contract, runtime, database or production behavior changed.

### Delivery exact-head CI

Exact head `55193e83ddb6c6e440532a58990eef6c34fde383`:

- Agent governance run `31884281263`: **PASS**;
- Merge authority audit run `31884281256`: **PASS**;
- Merge gate run `31884281277`: **PASS**;
- required `Merge gate / validate`: **PASS**;
- dependency review, governance and CodeQL sub-gates: **PASS**;
- Rust-only sub-gates: correctly skipped for documentation-only scope.

## Review and audit history

- The review was independently re-derived from current repository facts and accepted architecture rather than copying the first-pass conclusion as authority.
- The second pass upheld `ACCEPT_WITH_CHANGES` but added stronger PM/delivery constraints around migration timing, META creation, release identities, CI cost, heavy asset storage and future extraction.
- Exact-head self-review found zero material architecture/ownership/security/current-vs-target contradictions.
- A separate independent reviewer was not required for this low-risk non-authoritative documentation audit because it changed no accepted ADR/contract, authority/security rule, protocol, durable-data invariant, production path or executable public contract.

## Lifecycle closeout

The closeout performs only:

- active task -> archive;
- release of task-owned paths;
- preservation of delivery/review/CI evidence.

No linked Issue was created for this task. No other PR is superseded or terminalized by this closeout.
