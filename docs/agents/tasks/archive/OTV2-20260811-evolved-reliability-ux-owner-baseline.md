## Outcome

Persist the owner's explicit acceptance that the **first Evolved differentiation strategy is reliability/UX-first**: Oteryn should first improve player-visible trust, usability, recovery and clarity while avoiding an initial broad redesign of combat power, progression, death, PvP, boss rewards or economy.

The owner-accepted architecture delivery is complete. This archived record preserves the full task context and terminal delivery evidence. The lifecycle closeout only moves the completed record from `active/` to `archive/`; it does not change the product decision.

## Architecture and source of truth

- `USER_SOURCE`: on 2026-08-11, after the recommendation was stated as “first Evolved difference = reliability/UX-first; better client, reconnect, messages, interface, convenience and technical quality before balance/death/economy/core progression”, the owner answered `tak`.
- `PROVEN`: `GAME-VISION-01_PLAYER_PROMISE_OWNER_BASELINE.md` requires modern reliable native quality and explicit/versioned/measurable intentional Oteryn differences.
- `PROVEN`: `GAME-VISION-01_REFERENCE_FIRST_OWNER_BASELINE.md` makes the first external evaluation Reference-first rather than Evolved-first.
- `PROVEN`: `GAME-VISION-01_REFERENCE_HYBRID_TRACKING_OWNER_BASELINE.md` preserves immutable released Reference revisions and explicit promotion.
- `PROVEN`: `GAME-VISION-01_PREDECISION_ANALYSIS.md` defines reliability/UX-first as Strategy 1, contrasts it with immediate systemic gameplay redesign and a broad feature pack, and lists the first Evolved strategy as owner-decision packet item 5 required for the minimum product contract.
- `PROVEN`: ADR-0010 keeps Reference and Evolved on one canonical engine/client/`protocol-oteryn` and requires Evolved differences to be explicit and reviewable.
- `PROVEN`: PR #163 final head `88ac5fa32b999e158ea54cb6d8af7068148e824f` passed exact-head self-review and repository-required CI, all material review threads were resolved, and the PR squash-merged as `d8d3e5e26e26673880bad7e615cdc4b1ec5e779c`.
- `DERIVED`: this decision selects the ordering/character of the first Evolved package, not its exact feature list. Semantically neutral reliability/UX improvements that preserve Reference gameplay should not be artificially withheld from Reference merely to manufacture Evolved differentiation.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Record reliability/UX-first as the owner-accepted first Evolved strategy.
- [x] State that the first Evolved package should minimize gameplay-power/economy disturbance while improving trust, usability, recovery and clarity.
- [x] Preserve server authority, persistence/value integrity, Reference parity and one shared engine/client/protocol foundation.
- [x] Make clear that shared semantic-neutral reliability/UX improvements may benefit Reference too and need not be Evolved-exclusive.
- [x] Keep exact feature inventory, UI design, numeric KPIs and rollout mechanics unresolved.
- [x] Keep death/progression/PvP/economy/boss-loot/systemic redesign out of the first package unless separately owner-accepted.
- [x] Keep full `GAME-VISION-01` explicitly `NOT ACCEPTED`.
- [x] Include decision-timing, concrete blocked downstream work, cost-of-delay and supersession-evidence records.
- [x] No runtime/client/server/content/production implementation is authorized.
- [x] Exact-head self-review and repository-required CI passed before merge.

## Excluded scope

This task did not:

- implement any client, server, protocol, persistence, content, deployment or production change;
- freeze an exact Evolved feature list or UI mockup;
- select exact reconnect timers, grace periods, channel-switch mechanics or recovery algorithms;
- redesign or accept death penalty, progression rates, PvP rules, vocation balance, boss rewards, spawn economics or economy formulas;
- claim that every reliability/UX improvement is Evolved-only;
- alter the Reference-first or hybrid Reference tracking baselines;
- finalize public branding, monetization, KPI targets or LiveOps cadence;
- modify parallel PR #162 merge-gate/governance owned paths.

## Implementation / findings

- Main at task start was `f184930fac66fdf9ae0cc7f606d3502c17626a79`.
- Parallel PR #162 (`ci: enforce aggregate pull request merge gate`) owned disjoint repository-engineering/governance paths. This task never modified those paths.
- Added `docs/architecture/GAME-VISION-01_EVOLVED_RELIABILITY_UX_FIRST_OWNER_BASELINE.md` as a separate owner-accepted partial baseline.
- The owner acceptance resolves only owner-decision packet item 5 from `GAME-VISION-01_PREDECISION_ANALYSIS.md`.
- The baseline distinguishes shared semantic-neutral reliability/UX quality from true Evolved-specific product/ruleset differences, preventing an artificial “worse Reference” interpretation.
- Full `GAME-VISION-01` remains `NOT ACCEPTED`; no executable implementation or production rollout was authorized.

### CI recovery cycle 1 — PR metadata event payload

Initial Agent Governance run `31476089174` failed before checkout because the original PR body used `## Parallel coordination` instead of the mandatory literal `## Scope` heading. The workflow log proved the exact cause: `PR body is missing ## Scope`.

Recovery actions:

- corrected PR #163 metadata so the body contained mandatory `## Summary`, `## Scope` and `## Validation` headings;
- attempted one job rerun without moving the head;
- rerun job `93730563639` failed identically because GitHub reruns reused the original `pull_request` event payload;
- a justified task checkpoint generated a fresh `synchronize` event with corrected metadata;
- fresh Agent Governance subsequently passed; this recovery never changed the architecture/product semantics.

### Review repair cycle 1 — concrete blocked work

Automatic review on an older head raised a valid P1: decision timing answered `YES` but initially described only work the decision broadly constrained while task metadata still had `blocks: []`.

Repair applied:

- the architecture baseline explicitly names work that cannot safely close while the strategy is ambiguous: `GAME-VISION-01` owner-decision packet item 5, the scope/acceptance plan for the first Evolved product proof or later alpha milestone, and prioritization of the first Evolved candidate backlog;
- task `blocks` metadata mirrors those concrete dependencies;
- later `DUR-04`/profile planning is classified as constrained rather than falsely claimed as fully blocked.

This repair strengthened decision-timing evidence only; owner-accepted reliability/UX-first semantics were unchanged.

## Validation

### Focused

- command/run: full diff and authority-boundary inspection against `GAME-VISION-01_PREDECISION_ANALYSIS.md`, `GAME-VISION-01_PLAYER_PROMISE_OWNER_BASELINE.md`, accepted Reference baselines, ADR-0010 and PR #162 changed-path inventory
- result: **PASS** on final delivery head `88ac5fa32b999e158ea54cb6d8af7068148e824f`; declared product scope remained bounded and concrete blocked work was explicit

### Component/integration

- command/run: `NOT_APPLICABLE` — architecture/task documentation only; no executable component/integration behavior changed
- result: `NOT_APPLICABLE`

### E2E

- scenario: `NOT_APPLICABLE` — no runtime/client/server/content behavior changed
- result: `NOT_APPLICABLE`

### Exact-head CI

- final head: `88ac5fa32b999e158ea54cb6d8af7068148e824f`
- trigger source: `pull_request/synchronize`
- workflow/run/job:
  - Agent Governance run `31476683875`: **success**
  - Dependency Review run `31476683866`: **success**
  - CodeQL run `31476683941`: **success**
- runner assignment: completed
- classification: repository-required documentation checks
- prior metadata failure: run `31476089174`, initial job `93730023249` and rerun `93730563639`; both failed on stale/original PR metadata and are superseded by the successful final-head generation
- result: **PASS**

## Audit

- scope: owner-authority fidelity, decision-timing justification, accidental gameplay-policy freeze, accidental Reference degradation, shared-stack/profile-boundary conflict, task-template completeness, parallel ownership collision and PR-governance recovery correctness
- material findings: one PR-metadata governance issue repaired through bounded recovery; one valid P1 on concrete blocked work repaired in cycle 1; one older checkpoint P1 became outdated after task advancement; zero open material findings on final head
- unresolved findings: **0** at delivery merge; threads `PRRT_kwDOTuGrds6YKz36` and `PRRT_kwDOTuGrds6YKz3-` were replied with final-head evidence and resolved
- verdict: **PASS** on final delivery head

## Self-review

- exact head: `88ac5fa32b999e158ea54cb6d8af7068148e824f`
- method/reviewer: implementing/coordinating agent full-diff product/architecture/governance review
- review: `4904641894`
- material findings: `0`
- verdict: **PASS**

## Independent review

- required: `NO` under current risk policy — bounded product-definition documentation only; no authentication/session, protocol/wire, durable-data/economy conservation, security, production or multichannel-authority semantics changed
- exact head: `NOT_APPLICABLE`
- method/auditor: `NOT_APPLICABLE`
- material findings: `NOT_APPLICABLE`
- verdict: `NOT_APPLICABLE`

## PR and closeout

- changed-file review: **PASS** — delivery PR #163 changed only the task record and `GAME-VISION-01_EVOLVED_RELIABILITY_UX_FIRST_OWNER_BASELINE.md`
- unresolved review threads: **0** at delivery merge
- related/superseded PRs: parallel disjoint PR #162; no supersession
- protected auto-merge: `NOT_USED`; owner-authorized squash merge executed only after exact-head gates passed
- merge commit/result: PR #163 squash-merged as `d8d3e5e26e26673880bad7e615cdc4b1ec5e779c`
- ownership release: lifecycle closeout branch moves this full completed record to `archive/`; closeout PR number pending
