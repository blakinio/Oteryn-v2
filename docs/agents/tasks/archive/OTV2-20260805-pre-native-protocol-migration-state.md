## Outcome

Completed and merged the owner-accepted migration invariant that the atomic Rust-client destination migration may produce a compilable and launchable `pre-native-protocol` client state while production gameplay entry remains explicitly unavailable until the native identifier, protocol, runtime and admission gates are implemented and validated.

## Architecture and source of truth

- `ACCEPTED`: ADR-0011 names `pre-native-protocol` as a programme transition state, not a player-selectable protocol mode, compatibility profile or permanent product variant.
- `ACCEPTED`: the state contains no production gameplay protocol adapter.
- `ACCEPTED`: `protocol-canary` remains `REFERENCE_ONLY` and absent from workspace membership, production dependencies, negotiation, fallback, translation and release packaging.
- `ACCEPTED`: no empty, stubbed, incomplete or speculative production `protocol-oteryn` crate may be created to make migration appear complete.
- `ACCEPTED`: the migrated client may compile and launch, but every production gameplay-entry path fails closed before credential consumption, Game Session binding or gameplay endpoint connection.
- `ACCEPTED`: `FND-02` ends the no-native-protocol design state but does not alone authorize gameplay; `FND-ID-01`, `FND-03`, `FND-04` and their validation/rollout evidence remain mandatory.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] ADR-0011 defines the transition state and its exact security/product invariants.
- [x] The migration cannot retain `protocol-canary` as a temporary production adapter.
- [x] The migration cannot create an empty or speculative `protocol-oteryn` production crate.
- [x] The client may compile and launch while production gameplay entry fails closed before sensitive boundaries.
- [x] User-facing, test, telemetry and support evidence cannot imply that gameplay is available.
- [x] `FND-02` is recorded as necessary but not sufficient for production gameplay.
- [x] No runtime code, Cargo workspace, protocol schema or external repository was modified.
- [x] Exact-head governance, Dependency Review and CodeQL passed.
- [x] Independent architecture audit completed with zero open material findings.
- [x] PR #44 was squash-merged and ownership released.

## Excluded scope

No client migration, workspace mutation, protocol schema/codec implementation, Platform or Game Gateway implementation, game-server runtime, admission behavior, external-repository write or final launcher/login UX decision was performed.

## Implementation / findings

Merged deliverables:

- `docs/architecture/ADR-0011-native-client-pre-protocol-migration-state.md`;
- this task's architecture evidence and lifecycle record.

The decision preserves a buildable migration target without retaining Canary or inventing a premature native protocol. It requires deterministic, visible and fail-closed behavior before credential handoff and distinguishes migration readiness from gameplay readiness.

## Validation

### Focused

- command/run: complete PR #44 changed-file review against base `71cff9ca07900d76a78607484447a357cfbc245f` after branch synchronization
- result: `PASS`; the final PR diff contained exactly the declared ADR and task record

### Component/integration

- command/run: `NOT_APPLICABLE` — documentation-only architecture task
- result: `NOT_APPLICABLE`

### E2E

- scenario: `NOT_APPLICABLE` — no executable runtime or player-facing behavior changed
- result: `NOT_APPLICABLE`

### Exact-head CI

- head: `42bb3da12c7bcc80d098219044a1b8c817959d2f`
- Agent governance: run `31049120127` — `PASS`
- Dependency review: run `31049120119` — `PASS`
- CodeQL: run `31049120229` — `PASS`
- result: `PASS`

## Independent audit

- exact architecture head: `509537597dec8980ea81dad80e84ab719fd8d369`; synchronized final head `42bb3da12c7bcc80d098219044a1b8c817959d2f` retained the same task-owned diff
- method/auditor: adversarial full-diff architecture review against ADR-0001, ADR-0002, ADR-0008, FND-01, VSL-02, FND-ID-01, FND-02, FND-03 and FND-04
- resolved material finding:
  - the owner's initial confirmation named `FND-02` as the protocol milestone, but `FND-02` alone cannot authorize production gameplay; ADR-0011 explicitly preserves the identifier, runtime, admission and exact validation gates
- open material findings: none
- verdict: `PASS`

## PR and closeout

- changed-file review: two declared documentation files only
- unresolved review threads: none
- required checks: all passed on exact final head
- synchronization: branch updated with `main` commit `71cff9ca07900d76a78607484447a357cfbc245f` before final validation
- merge result: PR #44 squash-merged as `4f50f137cb381caf90a68a8f77258147caea6ccd`
- ownership release: complete through this archive move
