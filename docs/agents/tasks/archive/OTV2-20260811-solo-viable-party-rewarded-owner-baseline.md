## Outcome

Persist the owner's explicit acceptance of the Oteryn product baseline **solo viable, party rewarded**: meaningful ordinary progression and normal sessions remain viable without permanent party dependence, while coordinated party play has real gameplay value.

The owner-accepted architecture delivery is complete. This archive preserves the complete task record plus terminal review/CI/merge evidence. Lifecycle closeout only moves the completed record from `active/` to `archive/`; it does not change the product decision.

## Architecture and source of truth

- `USER_SOURCE`: on 2026-08-11, after the recommendation was explained as “solo viable, party rewarded” — normal solo progression remains meaningful, while organized parties gain real benefits such as greater efficiency, access to harder coordinated goals, profession synergy and safety without forcing a party for every ordinary session — the owner answered `tak`.
- `PROVEN`: `GAME-VISION-01_PREDECISION_ANALYSIS.md` identifies relative solo/party importance as owner-decision packet item 7 and explicitly says the baseline is needed so `GAME-CHAR-01`, shared XP and content sizing do not guess.
- `PROVEN`: accepted Reference-first and hybrid-tracking baselines keep Reference mechanics tied to a named immutable parity target.
- `PROVEN`: accepted Evolved reliability/UX-first does not automatically authorize early systemic progression/party redesign.
- `PROVEN`: accepted PvP secondary-pillar baseline leaves detailed gameplay mechanics to their owning gates.
- `PROVEN`: delivery PR #167 final head `2a1ea9d7b13b0579027cd4760a4162d0d0f91820` passed exact-head self-review and all repository-required CI with zero review threads, then squash-merged as `88dba5e89954db77c01b95e7946a408e21f0ccf0`.
- `DERIVED`: the owner acceptance is product emphasis, not a numeric party-reward formula or a requirement that all content be solo-completable.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Record `solo viable, party rewarded` as the owner-accepted product-level solo/party emphasis.
- [x] Define solo viability as meaningful ordinary progression without permanent party dependence.
- [x] Define party reward as real cooperative gameplay value without selecting a specific bonus formula.
- [x] State that not every boss/quest/event/endgame objective must be soloable.
- [x] State that routine play must not require constant party formation.
- [x] Keep shared-XP formula, party bonus values, party-size/level/vocation rules and loot distribution unresolved.
- [x] Keep party finder, channel/co-location, instance admission and multibox/account policy unresolved in their owning gates.
- [x] Preserve Reference parity authority and explicit/versioned/measurable Evolved differences.
- [x] Preserve server authority, durable-value integrity, anti-duplication and abuse-resistant reward eligibility without inventing enforcement policy.
- [x] Include decision-timing, concrete blocked work, cost-of-delay and supersession-evidence records.
- [x] Keep full `GAME-VISION-01` explicitly `NOT ACCEPTED`.
- [x] No runtime/client/server/content/production implementation is authorized.
- [x] Exact-head self-review and repository-required CI passed before merge.

## Excluded scope

This task did not:

- implement party, shared-XP, progression, combat, boss, quest, loot, client-social or content behavior;
- define numeric XP/loot/efficiency bonuses or penalties;
- define party size, level range, vocation composition or synergy formulas;
- require that all content be soloable;
- select which exact bosses/quests/hunts require or reward groups;
- define personal/shared loot policy;
- define party finder/matchmaking or invite/kick/leadership rules;
- define cross-channel co-location, preferred-channel assignment or channel-switch semantics;
- define instance ownership/admission rules;
- define multi-account/multibox policy;
- alter accepted Reference-first, hybrid-tracking, player-promise, Evolved reliability/UX-first or PvP secondary-pillar decisions;
- modify parallel draft PR #162 repository-engineering/governance paths;
- authorize production rollout.

## Implementation / findings

- Main at task start was `470f269d338e085f40910ca79e60a5a8d8ea4abf`.
- Parallel PR #162 (`ci: enforce aggregate pull request merge gate`) remained a draft owning disjoint repository-engineering/governance paths; this task never modified those paths.
- Repository search found no earlier owner baseline for `solo viable, party rewarded`.
- `GAME-VISION-01_PREDECISION_ANALYSIS.md` owner-decision packet item 7 is `Solo/party emphasis` and exists so `GAME-CHAR-01`, shared XP and content sizing do not guess.
- Added `docs/architecture/GAME-VISION-01_SOLO_VIABLE_PARTY_REWARDED_OWNER_BASELINE.md` as a separate owner-accepted partial baseline.
- The final baseline distinguishes product intent from mechanics: solo viability does not mean every content item is soloable, and party reward does not imply a specific XP multiplier.
- Full `GAME-VISION-01` remains `NOT ACCEPTED`; no executable implementation or rollout was authorized.

## Validation

### Focused

- command/run: compare owner acceptance with `GAME-VISION-01_PREDECISION_ANALYSIS.md` item 7 and accepted Reference/player-promise/Evolved/PvP baselines; verify no prior solo/party owner baseline; inspect draft PR #162 for path collision and delivery PR #167 scope
- result: **PASS** on final delivery head `2a1ea9d7b13b0579027cd4760a4162d0d0f91820`

### Component/integration

- command/run: `NOT_APPLICABLE` — product/architecture/task documentation only; no executable component/integration behavior changed
- result: `NOT_APPLICABLE`

### E2E

- scenario: `NOT_APPLICABLE` — no runtime/client/server/content behavior changed
- result: `NOT_APPLICABLE`

### Exact-head CI

- final head: `2a1ea9d7b13b0579027cd4760a4162d0d0f91820`
- trigger source: `pull_request/synchronize`
- workflow/run/job:
  - Agent Governance run `31482282662`: **success**
  - Dependency Review run `31482282826`: **success**
  - CodeQL run `31482282655`: **success**
- runner assignment: completed
- classification: repository-required documentation checks
- result: **PASS**

## Audit

- scope: owner-authority fidelity, accidental shared-XP/party-bonus freeze, accidental all-content-solo requirement, Reference/Evolved conflict, GAME-CHANNEL authority leakage, reward-integrity weakening, task-template completeness and parallel ownership collision
- material findings: zero material findings on final delivery head
- unresolved findings: **0**; PR #167 had no review threads at delivery merge
- verdict: **PASS** on final delivery head

## Self-review

- exact head: `2a1ea9d7b13b0579027cd4760a4162d0d0f91820`
- method/reviewer: implementing/coordinating agent full-diff product/architecture/governance review
- review: `4905212964`
- material findings: `0`
- verdict: **PASS**

## Independent review

- required: `NO` under current risk policy — bounded product-priority documentation only; no authentication/session, protocol/wire, persistence/economy conservation, security, production configuration or executable multichannel authority semantics changed
- exact head: `NOT_APPLICABLE`
- method/auditor: `NOT_APPLICABLE`
- material findings: `NOT_APPLICABLE`
- verdict: `NOT_APPLICABLE`

## PR and closeout

- changed-file review: **PASS** — delivery PR #167 changed only the task record and `GAME-VISION-01_SOLO_VIABLE_PARTY_REWARDED_OWNER_BASELINE.md`
- unresolved review threads: **0** at delivery merge
- related/superseded PRs: parallel disjoint draft PR #162; no supersession
- protected auto-merge: `NOT_USED`; owner-authorized squash merge executed only after exact-head gates passed
- merge commit/result: PR #167 squash-merged as `88dba5e89954db77c01b95e7946a408e21f0ccf0`
- ownership release: lifecycle closeout PR pending
