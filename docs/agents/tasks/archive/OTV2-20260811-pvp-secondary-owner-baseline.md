## Outcome

Persist the owner's explicit acceptance that **PvP is a secondary pillar of Oteryn**: a serious, supported part of the product where enabled, but not the dominant organizing principle for the entire game.

The owner-accepted architecture delivery is complete. This archive preserves the complete task record plus terminal review/CI/merge evidence. Lifecycle closeout only moves the completed record from `active/` to `archive/`; it does not change the product decision.

## Architecture and source of truth

- `USER_SOURCE`: on 2026-08-11 the owner accepted the explicit recommendation `PvP = secondary pillar` after the three product-level options were described.
- `PROVEN`: `GAME-VISION-01_PREDECISION_ANALYSIS.md` lists launch-level PvP importance as owner-decision packet item 6.
- `PROVEN`: the accepted player promise preserves recognizable Tibia depth/risk/world identity while keeping exact PvP rules unresolved.
- `PROVEN`: Reference-first and hybrid Reference tracking require any Reference PvP parity claim to remain tied to a named immutable target revision.
- `PROVEN`: Evolved reliability/UX-first means the first Evolved package is not a broad PvP/gameplay redesign.
- `PROVEN`: PR #165 final repaired head `f462da7ee4bd16a5cfad5de298291e8917d7e939` passed exact-head self-review and all repository-required CI, its material review thread was resolved, and the PR squash-merged as `fe6da8b962374cadc2324984e7d590a89dc830e3`.
- `DERIVED`: secondary pillar means PvP is important and production-quality where enabled, but product scope may remain bounded and Oteryn must remain coherent for PvE/progression/economy/social players without making PvP the universal center of the design.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Record PvP as the owner-accepted `secondary pillar` product priority.
- [x] State that secondary does not mean low correctness/safety/fairness priority.
- [x] State that PvP is not the sole organizing principle for progression, economy, content or social play.
- [x] Preserve Reference parity authority and explicit/versioned/measurable Evolved differences.
- [x] Keep exact PvP world types, skull/frag/war/death/damage/reward formulas unresolved.
- [x] Keep disconnect timers, channel-switch eligibility, anti-escape semantics, cooldowns and anti-hopping thresholds unresolved.
- [x] Preserve server authority, durable-value integrity, anti-duplication, anti-cheat and recovery safety without selecting `GAME-CHANNEL-01` PvP switching policy.
- [x] Keep first product-proof PvP breadth bounded and explicitly milestone-scoped rather than implicitly exhaustive.
- [x] Include mandatory decision-timing, concrete blocked work, cost-of-delay and supersession-evidence records.
- [x] Keep full `GAME-VISION-01` explicitly `NOT ACCEPTED`.
- [x] No runtime/client/server/content/production implementation is authorized.
- [x] Exact-head self-review and repository-required CI passed before merge.

## Excluded scope

This task did not:

- implement PvP, combat, death, reconnect, channel, anti-cheat, persistence or content behavior;
- select launch world types or PvP taxonomy;
- define skulls, frags, wars, unjustified kills, PvP rewards or rankings;
- define damage scaling, vocation balance or combat formulas;
- define death penalties, blessings or protection-loss mechanics;
- define safe-zone/protection-zone/PvP-area policy;
- define disconnect grace/post-grace behavior or logout-abuse enforcement;
- define whether or under what conditions PvP/combat state blocks channel changes;
- define anti-escape semantics, channel-switch cooldowns, combat-lock durations or anti-hopping thresholds;
- define transfer rules between future PvP/non-PvP world types;
- alter accepted Reference-first, hybrid tracking, player-promise or Evolved reliability/UX-first decisions;
- modify parallel PR #162 repository-engineering/governance owned paths;
- authorize production rollout.

## Implementation / findings

- Main at task start was `78c08e658cb4acb2f6e7298841b223d2ebf3cf5d`.
- Parallel PR #162 (`ci: enforce aggregate pull request merge gate`) was a draft owning disjoint repository-engineering/governance paths; this task never modified those paths.
- Repository search found no earlier PvP secondary-pillar owner baseline.
- Added `docs/architecture/GAME-VISION-01_PVP_SECONDARY_PILLAR_OWNER_BASELINE.md` as a separate owner-accepted partial baseline.
- The owner acceptance resolves only `GAME-VISION-01` owner-decision packet item 6; detailed PvP policy remains intentionally open.
- The final baseline distinguishes PvP feature breadth from PvP-sensitive safety/integrity invariants while preserving authority boundaries for downstream gates.

### Review repair cycle 1 — keep channel/PvP policy in `GAME-CHANNEL-01`

Automatic review on older head `77c19a5a0845131f6ce2ea87a6a1fbb0541f8860` raised valid P1 `Keep the channel-escape rule in its owning gate`.

The initial draft accidentally made a binding `no channel switch as immediate combat/PvP escape` statement even though the final owner policy for PvP/channel switching remains unresolved in `GAME-CHANNEL-01`.

Repair applied:

- removed the binding no-channel-escape requirement from this `GAME-VISION-01` baseline;
- explicitly left switching eligibility, combat/PvP interaction, anti-escape semantics and cooldowns to `GAME-CHANNEL-01` and related owning gates;
- expanded the unresolved-decision list accordingly;
- retained only product-level PvP importance and generic already-owned safety/integrity expectations.

The owner-accepted meaning `PvP = secondary pillar` was unchanged.

## Validation

### Focused

- command/run: compare owner acceptance with `GAME-VISION-01_PREDECISION_ANALYSIS.md`, accepted Reference/player-promise/Evolved baselines and ADR-0010; verify no prior owner baseline; inspect parallel PR #162 for path collision; inspect PR #165 authority boundaries after P1 repair
- result: **PASS** on final delivery head `f462da7ee4bd16a5cfad5de298291e8917d7e939`

### Component/integration

- command/run: `NOT_APPLICABLE` — architecture/task documentation only; no executable component/integration behavior changed
- result: `NOT_APPLICABLE`

### E2E

- scenario: `NOT_APPLICABLE` — no runtime/client/server/content behavior changed
- result: `NOT_APPLICABLE`

### Exact-head CI

- final head: `f462da7ee4bd16a5cfad5de298291e8917d7e939`
- trigger source: `pull_request/synchronize`
- workflow/run/job:
  - Agent Governance run `31479833455`: **success**
  - Dependency Review run `31479833194`: **success**
  - CodeQL run `31479833461`: **success**
- runner assignment: completed
- classification: repository-required documentation checks
- result: **PASS**

## Audit

- scope: owner-authority fidelity, PvP-priority overreach, accidental detailed PvP-rule freeze, `GAME-CHANNEL-01` authority leakage, Reference/Evolved conflict, safety/integrity weakening, milestone-scope ambiguity, task-template completeness, parallel ownership collision
- material findings: one valid P1 on unaccepted channel/PvP switching semantics; repaired in cycle 1; zero open material findings on final head
- unresolved findings: **0** at delivery merge; thread `PRRT_kwDOTuGrds6YLkjR` was replied with repaired-head evidence and resolved
- verdict: **PASS** on final delivery head

## Self-review

- exact head: `f462da7ee4bd16a5cfad5de298291e8917d7e939`
- method/reviewer: implementing/coordinating agent full-diff product/architecture/governance review
- review: `4904957760`
- material findings: `0`
- verdict: **PASS**

## Independent review

- required: `NO` under current risk policy — bounded product-priority documentation only; no authentication/session, protocol/wire, persistence/economy conservation, production configuration or executable multichannel authority semantics changed
- exact head: `NOT_APPLICABLE`
- method/auditor: `NOT_APPLICABLE`
- material findings: `NOT_APPLICABLE`
- verdict: `NOT_APPLICABLE`

## PR and closeout

- changed-file review: **PASS** — delivery PR #165 changed only the task record and `GAME-VISION-01_PVP_SECONDARY_PILLAR_OWNER_BASELINE.md`
- unresolved review threads: **0** at delivery merge
- related/superseded PRs: parallel disjoint draft PR #162; no supersession
- protected auto-merge: `NOT_USED`; owner-authorized squash merge executed only after exact-head gates passed
- merge commit/result: PR #165 squash-merged as `fe6da8b962374cadc2324984e7d590a89dc830e3`
- ownership release: lifecycle closeout PR pending
