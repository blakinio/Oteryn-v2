## Outcome

Delivered one complete **nonbinding** `GAME-CHAR-01` pre-decision dossier that separates baseline-neutral character lifecycle/ownership/progression architecture from Reference-sensitive mechanics that remain fail-closed until the exact first Reference baseline is selected.

Canonical analysis:

- `docs/architecture/GAME-CHAR-01_PREDECISION_ANALYSIS.md`.

The dossier remains `PRE-DECISION ANALYSIS / NOT ACCEPTED`. It creates no owner acceptance and no runtime/schema authority.

## Architecture findings

- `PROVEN`: accepted Character Authority, FND-ID and FND-04 boundaries already fix CharacterId identity, AccountId/WorldId relationship ownership, one-online-character authority and GameSession/CharacterLease separation.
- `PROVEN`: accepted GAME-VISION requires Reference-sensitive behavior to stop rather than guess until the exact named first Reference baseline is selected.
- `DERIVED`: full GAME-CHAR closure should be staged inside one gate: Stage A baseline-neutral semantics may be owner-accepted now; Stage B remains hard-blocked on the exact Reference baseline where concrete character-visible mechanics/durable vocabulary are target-sensitive.
- `PROVEN`: `ARCHITECTURE_STATUS_MODEL.md` has no `DecisionStatus=PARTIAL`; if Stage A is later accepted, a dedicated owner-accepted partial baseline should bind its declared scope while the overall GAME-CHAR row remains `PROPOSED / PLANNED / NOT_STARTED` after that partial delivery lifecycle closes.
- `PROVEN`: PR #162 remained disjoint repository-governance work and was untouched.

## Recommended Stage-A package — still NOT accepted

The dossier recommends:

1. bounded Character aggregate ownership, explicitly excluding item/economy/social/house/market/session authorities;
2. minimal lifecycle `ACTIVE -> DELETION_SCHEDULED -> RETIRED`, restore only before terminal retirement, privacy erasure separate, CharacterId never reused;
3. atomic idempotent creation with final name reservation and versioned starter/ruleset context;
4. character-state revision/fence distinct from FND-04 session/lease fencing;
5. quiescent first-generation terminal retirement/world transfer/account transfer: actor `ABSENT` and no playable CharacterLease before commit;
6. authoritative progression facts separated from derived values; no assumption that progression is numerically monotonic;
7. idempotent/versioned character death consequences while exact Reference death rules wait for Stage B and item effects remain item-owned;
8. explicit ruleset/profile migration with no silent reinterpretation;
9. vocation/build state as versioned ruleset-owned character state, not an engine fork;
10. offline progression only as an explicit ruleset capability;
11. Character Authority remains final naming/quota arbiter while exact namespace/recycling/quota values remain Reference/product-sensitive;
12. transfer architecture is a capability rather than a first-launch promise;
13. DUR-02 may consume only Stage-A invariants before Stage B;
14. full GAME-CHAR remains not accepted until exact first Reference baseline selection and Reference-sensitive reconciliation.

## Hard-gated Stage-B remainder

At minimum the exact Reference target must reconcile:

- name namespace/normalization/recycling behavior;
- creation choices/starter state;
- persistent progression catalogue and exact semantics;
- vocation/class/promotion state relevant to durability;
- death/respawn/progression-loss/blessing/protection behavior;
- offline training/progression if present;
- slot/quota behavior where Reference-visible;
- deterministic fixtures/formulas owned by the applicable gameplay/simulation gates.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] inventoried accepted character identity/authority/session invariants without reopening them;
- [x] separated baseline-neutral and Reference-sensitive decision classes;
- [x] recommended bounded Character aggregate ownership;
- [x] recommended minimal lifecycle/deletion/restore/retirement semantics;
- [x] recommended safe first-generation mutation/quiescence rules;
- [x] separated progression facts from derived values without freezing formulas/schema;
- [x] defined ruleset migration and offline-progression boundaries;
- [x] mapped DUR-02/GAME-ITEM/combat/Platform/FND-04 boundaries;
- [x] produced the Stage-A owner decision package and exact Stage-B hard blocker;
- [x] changed no runtime/protocol/schema/content/external repository/accepted owner baseline;
- [x] exact-head self-review and repository-required CI passed before merge.

## Delivery validation

### Focused reconciliation

Compared the dossier against:

- `GAME-VISION-01_MINIMUM_OWNER_BASELINE.md`;
- ADR-0012 and `CHARACTER_AUTHORITY_PLATFORM_BOUNDARY.md`;
- FND-ID CharacterId/account-link and single-online-character owner baselines;
- FND-04 integration contract;
- DUR-01 durable representation split;
- `ARCHITECTURE_STATUS_MODEL.md`;
- current main and PR #162 ownership.

Result: **PASS**.

### Component/integration

`NOT_APPLICABLE` — nonbinding architecture analysis only.

### Runtime E2E

`NOT_APPLICABLE` — no executable/player-visible behavior changed.

### Exact-head CI

Final delivery head: `87d9189fad592a06ad0c8b44c2620e635ab96607`.

- Agent Governance run `31505771271` / generation #812 — **success**;
- Dependency Review run `31505771321` / generation #580 — **success**;
- CodeQL run `31505771277` / generation #700 — **success**.

### Self-review

- exact head: `87d9189fad592a06ad0c8b44c2620e635ab96607`;
- PR review: `4907753754`;
- material findings: `0`;
- verdict: **PASS**.

### Independent review

- required: `NO` under trusted-base risk policy;
- reason: nonbinding paper-only analysis with no accepted semantic/runtime/security/protocol/persistence/production change.

## PR and closeout

- delivery PR: #175;
- delivery changed files: exactly 2 declared documentation paths;
- unresolved review threads at merge: `0`;
- delivery merge: `f9d459c3d658c71c1f79a3f7d10990286371e1fb`;
- owner recommendation acceptance: **NOT PERFORMED**;
- runtime/production authority: **NONE**;
- next programme action: product owner accepts/replaces the Stage-A package; after acceptance the exact first Reference baseline becomes the next material hard-gated GAME-CHAR input.
