## Outcome

Persisted the product owner's explicit acceptance of the complete minimum `GAME-VISION-01` closure package and synchronized current architecture coordination state without authorizing runtime.

Canonical accepted source:

- `docs/architecture/GAME-VISION-01_MINIMUM_OWNER_BASELINE.md`.

The minimum `GAME-VISION-01` product-vision gate is semantically accepted. Exact first Reference baseline selection, detailed gameplay/economy formulas, numeric KPI targets, branding, monetization, exact first Evolved feature inventory, LiveOps cadence and downstream gameplay/durability gates remain explicitly unresolved or separately owned.

## Architecture and source of truth

- `USER_SOURCE`: on 2026-08-11 the product owner explicitly answered `tak` to acceptance of the complete recommended minimum closure package in sections 5-8 of `GAME-VISION-01_MINIMUM_CLOSURE_DECISION_PACKET.md`.
- `PROVEN`: seven earlier GAME-VISION partial owner baselines remain binding and were not rewritten.
- `PROVEN`: `GAME-VISION-01_MINIMUM_OWNER_BASELINE.md` records the accepted core/session/long-term loop, Reference-rule-first economy/scarcity philosophy, category-level success evidence and accepted deferral/hard-gate policy.
- `PROVEN`: exact first Global Tibia Reference baseline remains `DEFERRED WITH HARD GATE`; downstream scope that requires concrete Reference semantics must stop rather than guess.
- `PROVEN`: PR #173 final head `bf4d009877547f0d3581f8af874d8eee4e49a0a8` passed exact-head self-review and all repository-required CI before squash merge `c71081557c7bcb837d15571a4ed3837e2591a24b`.
- `PROVEN`: parallel PR #162 remained disjoint CI/repository-governance work and was untouched.

## Accepted minimum GAME-VISION result

The owner-accepted minimum direction now includes:

1. **Core/session loop** — player-chosen goal -> preparation -> travel/access -> risk/activity -> secure committed progress/value -> recovery/restock/trade/reorganize -> next goal.
2. **Long-term horizons** — character capability, equipment/wealth/resources, exploration/access/quest/encounter mastery, social/world relationships and increasingly difficult/rare/prestigious objectives.
3. **Reference economy** — mechanical source/sink parity rather than historical market-price/supply parity; conservation before tuning; measurable provenance; semantic scarcity; no hidden macro tuning.
4. **Success categories** — Reference correctness, player interaction quality, progress/value trust, core-loop health, economy health and product/operational health; numeric thresholds remain milestone-owned.
5. **Hard deferral discipline** — exact first Reference baseline is required before broad Reference semantics that cannot remain baseline-neutral; formulas/rates, KPI numbers, branding, monetization, exact Evolved inventory and LiveOps remain downstream.

This acceptance incorporates, rather than replaces, the earlier owner baselines for Reference-first, hybrid Reference tracking, the internal player promise, reliability/UX-first Evolved ordering, PvP-secondary, solo-viable/party-rewarded and Reference parity precedence.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Added the canonical owner baseline with exact acceptance boundary.
- [x] Preserved all seven earlier owner baselines without historical rewriting.
- [x] Marked `GAME-VISION-01` DecisionStatus `ACCEPTED` for the minimum gate while keeping ImplementationStatus `NOT_STARTED`.
- [x] Made `GAME-CHAR-01` the next product-sensitive architecture gate; preserved parallel `GAME-CHANNEL-01` and bounded `DUR-02` discovery.
- [x] Preserved exact Reference baseline selection as fail-closed wherever concrete parity semantics are required.
- [x] Preserved exact formulas, numeric KPI targets, branding, monetization, exact Evolved feature inventory and LiveOps cadence as downstream/deferred.
- [x] Did not authorize runtime/client/server/protocol/persistence/content/production implementation.
- [x] Kept PR #162 and all external repositories untouched.
- [x] Final-head full-diff self-review and all repository-required exact-head checks passed before merge.

## Delivery validation

### Focused architecture/product reconciliation

Compared the final owner baseline and synchronized mutable coordination files against:

- the delivered minimum-closure decision packet;
- all seven earlier GAME-VISION owner baselines;
- `ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW_REFINEMENTS_2026-08-10.md`;
- canonical foundation current status;
- global register and gameplay/product horizon;
- live `main` and PR #162 ownership.

Result: **PASS** — no owner-source mismatch, Reference/Evolved precedence conflict, accidental downstream acceptance or runtime-authority leakage.

### Component/integration

`NOT_APPLICABLE` — paper-only owner decision and coordination documentation.

### Runtime E2E

`NOT_APPLICABLE` — no executable/player-visible runtime behavior changed.

### Exact-head CI

Final delivery head: `bf4d009877547f0d3581f8af874d8eee4e49a0a8`.

- Agent Governance run `31503809594` / generation #806 — **success**;
- Dependency Review run `31503810003` / generation #576 — **success**;
- CodeQL run `31503810222` / generation #694 — **success**.

### Self-review

- exact head: `bf4d009877547f0d3581f8af874d8eee4e49a0a8`;
- PR review: `4907535082`;
- material findings: `0`;
- verdict: **PASS**.

### Independent review

- required: `NO` under trusted-base risk policy;
- reason: paper-only recording of an explicit owner product decision plus status reconciliation; no executable security/protocol/persistence/multichannel-authority/production change and no unresolved material uncertainty.

## Delivery PR and closeout

- delivery PR: #173;
- final delivery changed files: exactly 5 declared documentation paths;
- unresolved review threads at delivery merge: `0`;
- delivery merge: `c71081557c7bcb837d15571a4ed3837e2591a24b`;
- runtime/production authority: **NONE**;
- lifecycle closeout changes only task archival/ownership release and `GAME-VISION-01` DeliveryStatus `OPEN -> LIFECYCLE_CLOSED`; it does not alter the accepted product semantics.
