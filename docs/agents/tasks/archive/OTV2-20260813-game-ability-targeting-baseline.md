## Outcome

Delivered the owner-accepted second bounded `GAME-ABILITY-01` subdecision:

```text
Ability Invocation
-> Target Intent
-> bounded typed Target Query
-> authoritative Target Resolver
-> Resolved Target Set
-> Legality Evaluation
-> Validated Target Set / structured failure
-> typed Effect Plan
```

Ability content describes target policy but cannot supply authoritative final targets. Player, AI, NPC and system origins share one resolver. Target membership/order is bounded and deterministic. Effect planning cannot silently select different targets; chains/jumps/dynamic targeting require explicit bounded resolution steps.

Overall `GAME-ABILITY-01` remains open / `REQUIRED_FOR_ALPHA`.

## Acceptance result

- [x] Added the canonical targeting/legality owner baseline.
- [x] Preserved one resolver pipeline for player, AI, NPC and system origins.
- [x] Separated Target Intent, Target Query, authoritative resolution, legality and effect planning.
- [x] Required deterministic bounded target membership/order and explicit tie-breaking.
- [x] Prevented client/content/Wasm from supplying authoritative final target sets.
- [x] Required explicit bounded re-resolution for chains/jumps/dynamic retargeting.
- [x] Preserved FND-03 scope/ownership, DUR-04 capabilities, SIM determinism and ANL read-only evidence.
- [x] Kept exact gameplay algorithms/values and runtime/protocol/DDL/production authority out of scope.
- [x] Exact-head self-review and required CI passed before merge.

## Delivery validation

Exact delivery head: `9813e250da4ba08f36a794e464f0b1c6588ba864`.

- full two-file diff inspected against typed-effect, FND-03, DUR-04, SIM-DETERMINISM and ANL-01 boundaries;
- self-review: **PASS**, material findings `0`;
- Agent Governance `31718641829`: **PASS**;
- Dependency Review `31718641832`: **PASS**;
- CodeQL `31718641839`: **PASS**;
- unresolved review threads: `0`;
- independent review: **NOT_REQUIRED** for this bounded paper-only partial baseline;
- component/integration/runtime E2E: **NOT_APPLICABLE**;
- squash merge: `84da9a923ee504788444074eb71097e77a6463af`.

Issue creation was unavailable through the connector; the task record, PR #228 and workflow evidence are the durable sources.

## Deliberately unresolved

Exact target/query grammar, geometry catalogue, range/LoS/z-level algorithms, PvP/PZ/friendly-fire/immunity rules, legality/error precedence, partial-target semantics, Reference tie priorities, dynamic retarget snapshot timing, spatial index, protocol/client UX, physical authoring format, cast timing and combat formulas remain later decisions.

## Excluded scope preserved

No Rust runtime, target resolver implementation, combat formula, protocol schema, client UI, database schema/migration, Platform write, production behavior or external-repository mutation was introduced.
