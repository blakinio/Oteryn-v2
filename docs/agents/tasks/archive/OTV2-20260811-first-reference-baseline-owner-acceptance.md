## Outcome

Persisted the product owner's explicit acceptance of the complete first-Reference-baseline recommendation as canonical architecture.

Canonical owner baseline:

- `docs/architecture/GAME-VISION-01_FIRST_REFERENCE_BASELINE_OWNER_BASELINE.md`.

Accepted first Reference target:

> Global Tibia production-observable behavior after the **2026-07-28 server-save/maintenance change boundary**.

The target is immutable; later Global changes require an explicit later Reference revision. Target selection remains separate from evidence completeness and does not authorize implementation.

## Owner source

- `USER_SOURCE`: on 2026-08-11 at 22:09 +02:00 the product owner explicitly answered `Tak` to the full ten-item recommendation from `GAME-VISION-01_FIRST_REFERENCE_BASELINE_DECISION_DOSSIER.md` section 21.

## Accepted evidence/provenance contract

- material Reference behavior remains classified as `PROVEN`, `OBSERVED`, `DERIVED`, `UNKNOWN`, `CONFLICT` or `DECLARED_DIFFERENCE`;
- official public Tibia/CipSoft evidence is primary where applicable but is not assumed exhaustive;
- controlled lawful black-box observation is admissible with provenance and target-continuity evidence;
- reputable community documentation is corroborative/discovery input;
- Canary, crystalserver and other OTS implementations are hypothesis/inventory inputs only, never proof of Global behavior or production authority;
- absence of a discovered patch note/search result is not proof that no production change occurred;
- Reference-sensitive work must converge on a versioned evidence/parity manifest;
- security, integrity, legal and provenance constraints override defect compatibility;
- downstream Reference-sensitive domains use the same first target unless explicitly superseded/scoped.

## GAME-CHAR / DUR consequence

- GAME-CHAR Stage A remains the accepted partial baseline;
- the exact-target prerequisite for Stage B is satisfied;
- Stage B is unblocked for paper-only evidence reconciliation but remains **NOT ACCEPTED**;
- overall `GAME-CHAR-01` remains `PROPOSED / PLANNED / NOT_STARTED`;
- final character-bearing DUR-02 schema remains blocked on accepted Stage B/full GAME-CHAR closure;
- DUR-02 may use the target only as evidence/question/compatibility context before Stage-B acceptance.

## Review repair

Mandatory delivery self-review found two material pre-freeze register regressions:

1. the first register edit accidentally dropped the existing DUR-03 rule `Define item instance identity and ownership.`;
2. the first register edit introduced noncanonical status text `ACCEPTED PARTIAL SCOPE`.

Repair cycle 1 restored the DUR-03 rule and represented Stage-A partial scope with ordinary `ACCEPTED` plus explicit scope wording. No owner-approved semantics changed.

Repair budget used: `1/3`.

## Delivery validation

### Focused reconciliation

Result: **PASS** against the nonbinding Reference dossier, accepted GAME-VISION Reference-first/hybrid/parity-precedence baselines, GAME-CHAR Stage A, status model, DUR boundaries and no-runtime policy.

### Final-head self-review

- exact head: `2a07643653d6d56a94ada89caf79005fce09e58a`;
- review id: `4910439614`;
- final material findings: `0`;
- verdict: **PASS**;
- unresolved review threads at merge: `0`.

### Exact-head CI

Final delivery head `2a07643653d6d56a94ada89caf79005fce09e58a`:

- Agent Governance run `31532701302` / #833 — **success**;
- Dependency Review run `31532701303` / #595 — **success**;
- CodeQL run `31532701319` / #721 — **success**.

### Component/integration/runtime E2E

`NOT_APPLICABLE` — paper-only owner baseline and coordination documents; no executable/player-visible behavior changed.

### Independent review

- required: `NO` under trusted-base risk policy;
- reason: explicit owner-approved paper-only product/evidence target with no executable security/protocol/persistence/production change and no unresolved final material finding.

## Delivery PR and boundaries

- delivery PR: #181;
- changed files: exactly five declared documentation paths;
- squash merge: `b57b382cb929b2c8a20d5c81197e933b0526764f`;
- PR #162 remained disjoint repository-engineering/CI work and was untouched;
- external repositories were untouched;
- runtime/client/protocol/physical-schema/content/Platform/production authority: **NONE**.

## Next programme action

Start a separate bounded **paper-only `GAME-CHAR-01` Stage-B evidence reconciliation task** against the accepted 2026-07-28 target. Classify every candidate character semantic using the accepted evidence states; do not guess `UNKNOWN` or `CONFLICT` behavior and do not freeze physical persistence schema.

## Context checkpoint

```yaml
last_progress: First Reference target owner baseline delivered by PR #181 with repair cycle 1, exact-head self-review PASS and all required CI PASS; lifecycle closeout restores GAME-VISION delivery status to LIFECYCLE_CLOSED and releases ownership.
