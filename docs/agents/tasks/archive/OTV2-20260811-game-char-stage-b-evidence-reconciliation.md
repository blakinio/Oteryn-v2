## Outcome

Delivered the nonbinding Stage-B Reference evidence reconciliation:

- `docs/architecture/GAME-CHAR-01_STAGE_B_REFERENCE_EVIDENCE_RECONCILIATION.md`.

The dossier remains **PRE-DECISION / NOT ACCEPTED**. It concludes that full GAME-CHAR Stage B should not yet be presented for owner acceptance because eight material evidence blockers remain.

## Main findings

- July-28 Character Bazaar target-day evidence is useful but timestamp-sensitive: auction **start** around the maintenance boundary is relevant; auction **end** time is not a character-state snapshot timestamp.
- Official maintenance notice expected worlds/website back around 10:45 CEST, so July-28 listings beginning around 10:42–10:45 are conservatively `OBSERVED / strong target alignment`, not unconditional minute-exact post-cut proof.
- Five vocation families/promoted forms, level/experience/HP/mana/capacity/speed, blessing counts and named skill/build vocabulary have strong target-era evidence.
- Active-character quota 25 has strong pre/post primary continuity evidence.
- Seven regular blessings have pre-target primary introduction evidence plus target-day `/7` observations.
- Death-loss and offline-training timing have strong historical/current primary continuity but remain `DERIVED` rather than direct target snapshots.
- 2025 capacity migration applied the +200 base-capacity effect to existing characters only after level-up, proving Reference/import state cannot universally assume `capacity = pure_function(level, vocation)`.
- Dated March 2026 official news moved level-8+ flow to Targuna, while the currently indexed official Quick Start still describes Thais Peninsula/Blue Valley, proving official documentation can be stale for target chronology.

## Full Stage-B evidence blockers

1. naming normalization/uniqueness/recycling;
2. exact deletion grace/total quota/name-hold continuity;
3. exact creation/starter template;
4. exact experience/skill/speed formulas and authoritative-vs-derived mapping;
5. promotion target continuity and entitlement boundary;
6. PvP/skull/blessing/Death-Redemption persistent edge rules;
7. offline-training effectiveness/rounding/selectable-skill contract;
8. ownership of Wheel/proficiency/Animus/charm/task and adjacent modern build state.

No owner preference is required yet: these are primarily evidence-acquisition questions. Owner intervention becomes appropriate only if evidence remains unavailable/conflicting or an explicit Reference difference/simplification is required.

## Delivery repair

Repair cycle 1 corrected one material evidence-precision error:

- initial draft treated an auction ending Jul 28 10:00 CEST as direct post-cut evidence;
- repaired dossier distinguishes auction start from auction end and downgrades boundary-minute evidence appropriately;
- PR body was repaired to match without moving the delivery head.

Repair budget used: `1/3`.

## Delivery validation

- exact delivery head: `bf3e9efd32959fbc5b2abf59639f48a84799a170`;
- self-review: `4910694491` — **PASS**, zero final material findings;
- Agent Governance `31535491039` / #840 — **success**;
- Dependency Review `31535491016` / #600 — **success**;
- CodeQL `31535491141` / #728 — **success**;
- unresolved review threads at merge: `0`;
- branch behind main at merge: `0`;
- squash merge: `f0455f605099120d20fb016e85da726a5b6d0cc1`;
- component/integration/runtime E2E: `NOT_APPLICABLE`;
- independent review: `NOT_REQUIRED` for nonbinding paper-only analysis.

## Boundaries preserved

- overall `GAME-CHAR-01` remains `PROPOSED / PLANNED / NOT_STARTED`;
- Stage A remains the only accepted GAME-CHAR partial scope;
- accepted July-28 Reference target is unchanged;
- final character-bearing DUR-02 schema remains blocked on accepted Stage B/full GAME-CHAR closure;
- GAME-ITEM/DUR-03 retain item/value conservation authority;
- no runtime/client/protocol/physical-schema/content/Platform/production authority is created;
- PR #162 and external repositories were untouched.

## Next programme action

Continue autonomous Stage-B evidence acquisition, prioritizing B1/B2/B3: historical naming policy, deletion/quota continuity and exact creation/starter-state evidence. Preserve `UNKNOWN`/`CONFLICT` where target evidence cannot be established.
