## Outcome

PR #233 delivered the owner-accepted fourth partial `GAME-ABILITY-01` baseline:

- typed authoritative cooldown state with explicit subject/domain ownership;
- distinct rechargeable ability `ChargePool` semantics, separate from item charges;
- immutable/versioned `ConditionDefinition` separated from authoritative runtime `ConditionInstance`;
- explicit bounded condition admission/conflict/stack/refresh/replace policies;
- ability-/mechanic-driven condition transitions committed as typed effects/actions;
- condition ticks/repeated mutations through the existing Target/Legality/Effect Plan/`PRIMARY COMMIT` pipeline;
- distinct immunity, resistance, suppression and dispel layers;
- forward-only removal/expiry with no hidden rollback.

Overall `GAME-ABILITY-01` remains open / `REQUIRED_FOR_ALPHA`.

## Review and validation

Exact delivery head: `22d64a9e8e17de0a78c0df9cdaade1cd7b1da89f`.

Two pre-final boundary findings were repaired before freeze:

1. condition admission/refresh/stack/replace/dispel could have been read as an out-of-band mutation path; final baseline requires typed transition effects/actions and authoritative commit;
2. `global-style` cooldown and suppression wording could have implied process/world-global state or direct suppression mutation; final baseline scopes broad cooldowns to an explicit gameplay subject/domain and routes suppression changes through the typed transition boundary.

Final evidence:

- exact-head self-review: **PASS**, new material findings `0`;
- Agent Governance `31723075558`: **PASS**;
- Dependency Review `31723075543`: **PASS**;
- CodeQL `31723075546`: **PASS**;
- unresolved review threads: `0`;
- independent review: **NOT_REQUIRED** for this bounded paper-only partial baseline;
- component/integration/runtime E2E: **NOT_APPLICABLE**;
- squash merge: `fe8029f52ac5664733599203c7bc668c47e74aed`.

## Deliberately unresolved

Exact cooldown/global-cooldown groups or durations, charge capacities/recharge cadence, physical IDs/serializer, condition conflict keys, Reference condition values/tick cadence, immunity/resistance/suppression/dispel precedence, modifier algebra, persistence across logout/reconnect/restart, scheduler/runtime implementation, protocol/client UI and Reference ability/condition catalogue remain later decisions.

## Excluded scope preserved

No Rust gameplay runtime, protocol change, DDL/migration, Platform write, production behavior or external-repository mutation was introduced.
