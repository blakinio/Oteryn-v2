## Outcome

Delivered the canonical paper-only Reference evidence/parity manifest package for
the immutable Global Tibia production-observable behavior target after the
2026-07-28 server-save/maintenance change boundary.

Delivery PR #220 was squash-merged from exact final head
`33152bbfee6bb2be29fe5c37058c3f298e855327` as
`872b629e027b46abb4b558d61ee6104389d97ea7`.

The package establishes:

- a normative architecture contract separating target evidence, Oteryn
  implementation state and parity classification;
- a parseable initial manifest with no mechanic cases and no unsupported
  `PARITY_CONFIRMED` promotion;
- a normative JSON Schema Draft 2020-12 case/manifest schema;
- fail-closed handling for `UNKNOWN`, `CONFLICT`, provenance and declared
  differences;
- explicit empty coverage inventory for Character, Item, Channel,
  Content/World, Simulation, Ability/Combat, AI/Spawn, World Interaction and
  Economy;
- RFC 8785 JCS plus SHA-256 as the future deterministic identity contract,
  without inventing a digest before accepted tooling exists.

No runtime, client, server, protocol, persistence, content implementation,
PostgreSQL DDL/migration, Platform write, external-repository write, production
operation or proprietary material was authorized or introduced.

## Review and repair history

Initial exact head `047d5b78880504fa0096adad5d47c065d4ab0acb`
passed implementing-agent self-review with zero findings.

The owner explicitly authorized automatic Codex Review for delivery PR #220.
Codex Review `4928336133` found two material P2 issues:

1. the prose delegated case nullability/omission rules to a schema that did not
   exist;
2. the fail-closed domain inventory omitted Economy despite the accepted
   Reference baseline.

Both findings were repaired before the final head:

- added
  `docs/contracts/REFERENCE_EVIDENCE_PARITY_MANIFEST_V1.schema.json` and made
  it normative from both contract and manifest;
- added `ECONOMY / NO_MECHANIC_CASES_REGISTERED`;
- replied to and resolved review threads
  `PRRT_kwDOTuGrds6Y-PQe` and `PRRT_kwDOTuGrds6Y-PQk`.

Final full-scope verification confirmed both JSON documents parse, required
top-level fields are present, the manifest references the schema, Economy is
fail-closed, the case array is empty and no unauthorized parity promotion
exists.

## Terminal delivery validation

Exact delivery head: `33152bbfee6bb2be29fe5c37058c3f298e855327`.

- Agent governance run `31712494917` / run number 1058: **PASS**.
- CodeQL run `31712494914` / run number 946: **PASS**.
- Dependency Review run `31712494919` / run number 785: **PASS**.
- unresolved review threads immediately before merge: **0**.
- changed-file scope: exactly task record, architecture contract, manifest and
  v1 schema.
- component/integration/runtime E2E: **NOT_APPLICABLE** — paper-only contract
  and registry with no executable behavior.
- delivery merge: squash merge with
  `expected_head_sha=33152bbfee6bb2be29fe5c37058c3f298e855327`.
- linked issue #219: closed as completed by merge.

## Lifecycle closeout

This separate bookkeeping-only closeout:

- moves the task from `active` to `archive`;
- records immutable delivery/review/CI/merge evidence;
- releases all advisory ownership held by the task;
- changes no architecture, manifest semantics, runtime or production authority.

Independent review is **NOT_REQUIRED** under the trusted-base risk policy:
this closeout is a low-risk, non-semantic task-record move and evidence
reconciliation. Mandatory full-diff self-review remains required on the exact
closeout head.

## Context checkpoint
