## Result

The complete accepted 19-member Rust workspace was migrated into `blakinio/Oteryn-v2` in one atomic destination pull request. The merged workspace uses `MPL-2.0`, preserves truthful machine-readable provenance, separates production and synthetic dependency closures, and exposes a launchable pre-native client that fails closed before gameplay credentials, routing or transport.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Exactly 19 workspace members exist and match FND-01.
- [x] No Canary, gameplay protocol, transport, Game Session or speculative native crate was introduced.
- [x] Production app and synthetic harness closures are separated as required.
- [x] Toolchain, lockfile, formatting, cargo-deny and machine boundary policies are present.
- [x] Platform and Identity use bounded cancellable async I/O on the application-owned Tokio runtime.
- [x] Windows pre-native client build, strict Clippy, visible-shell smoke and synthetic harness pass.
- [x] Linux workspace build, strict Clippy, tests and synthetic harness pass.
- [x] Provenance, dependency delta and transformation evidence are complete.
- [x] Exact-head governance, Dependency Review, CodeQL and Rust workspace checks pass.
- [x] Adversarial migration audit passes with zero material findings.
- [x] PR #50 was squash-merged and destination `main` was verified.
- [x] Task ownership is released.

## Validation and merge evidence

Validated implementation head: `8177ce3a7a8aed57e644ad8a15fac1920433a68a`.

- Terminal cutover audit run `31095053578`: PASS across Linux, Windows, supply-chain and adversarial migration audit.

Exact final head: `5092f868a42d545f47a98c0b9723210570cd9d45`.

- Agent governance run `31095853261`: PASS.
- Dependency Review run `31095853437`: PASS.
- CodeQL run `31095853606`: PASS.
- Rust workspace run `31095853343`: PASS across Linux, Windows, policy/metadata and supply-chain jobs.
- Review threads: zero.
- Final mergeability: mergeable.
- Squash merge commit: `78988f72a80cc904aa9176ae850c50d4efa0b0f0`.
- Post-merge `main` verification: `78988f72a80cc904aa9176ae850c50d4efa0b0f0` is the current verified main head.

## Excluded scope preserved

- No write was made to `blakinio/otclient` by this task.
- No `protocol-oteryn`, `protocol-canary`, gameplay transport or Game Session implementation was introduced.
- No production deployment, live Identity/Gateway call or proprietary asset import occurred.

## Handover

The destination cutover is complete. The source repository must now receive an explicit source-only historical marker for `oteryn-client/`. After that marker is merged, the next foundational architecture decision is `FND-ID-01`.
