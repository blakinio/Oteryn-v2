## Completion summary

ANL-01 is accepted as architecture-only Game Event and Audit Foundation. It does not implement runtime collection, PostgreSQL/outbox schema, broker/warehouse, detectors or production analytics.

Canonical delivered artifacts:

- runtime/component/browser E2E: `NOT_APPLICABLE`.

## Accepted core decisions

- protobuf/proto3 event interchange independent from broker/DB;
- strong EventId/OperationId/TransactionId/CorrelationId and typed CausationRef semantics;
- domain+epoch pseudonymous AnalyticsActorId with fresh ID each epoch;
- BEST_EFFORT_TELEMETRY versus DURABLE_AUDIT;
- immutable same-EventId semantic envelope + exact payload bytes;
- RuntimeOrderRef and TransactionEventRef scoped ordering/completeness;
- no global event total order;
- semantic mutation/audit atomicity, at-least-once publication, EventId dedupe and read-only replay;
- privacy/finite-retention/access gate before production collection;
- bounded resource/error/failure evidence contract.

## Repair history

Cycle 1 fixed Protobuf retry byte drift, runtime ordinal ownership-generation scope and missing transaction event count.

Cycle 2 structurally bound TransactionId+ordinal+count, required fresh AnalyticsActorId across epochs and froze the full semantic envelope across same-EventId retry/redelivery.

No third material repair cycle was required.

## Next dependency

`DUR-02 — Persistence v1` is the next direct persistence architecture gate. It consumes accepted DUR-01 + ANL-01 and remains architecture-only until separately authorized implementation.
