## Outcome

Recorded the owner's explicit `USER_SOURCE` acceptance of the complete six-rule minimum whole-`DUR-02 — Persistence v1` closure package and the exhaustive fourteen-subject reconciliation in:

- `docs/architecture/DUR-02_PERSISTENCE_V1_OWNER_BASELINE.md`.

The accepted Character persistence partial baseline remains binding and is consumed rather than superseded.

Canonical post-closeout state:

```text
DUR-02 — Persistence v1
DecisionStatus       = ACCEPTED
DeliveryStatus       = LIFECYCLE_CLOSED
ImplementationStatus = NOT_STARTED
Runtime authority    = NONE
PostgreSQL DDL / migration execution authority = NONE
```

## Owner source

On 2026-08-12 at 09:41 +02:00, after the complete six-rule package and fourteen-subject reconciliation were presented, the owner replied:

> tak

That reply is the authoritative user acceptance source for this whole-gate baseline.

## Binding accepted architecture

The whole-gate owner baseline binds:

1. one ordered game-owned migration history for the current native game database boundary, explicit immutable project-owned migration artifacts, a dedicated least-privilege migrator and no production runtime auto-schema-sync;
2. anomaly-proof transaction isolation/locking/retry semantics, using READ COMMITTED only with explicit race closure and bounded SERIALIZABLE/stricter domain mechanism otherwise, preserving semantic operation identity across retry;
3. one ANL-compatible durable journal plus mutable crash-safe publication claim/checkpoint state, atomically committed when evidence is mandatory and preserving the same EventId/content through ambiguous delivery outcomes;
4. strict separation of acknowledged committed durability from FND-03 runtime checkpoint/replay and separately measured disaster-recovery RPO;
5. PITR-capable, restore-tested, fail-closed disaster recovery with a strictly newer non-rollback authority fence/equivalent before admission resumes;
6. common expand -> migrate/backfill -> validate -> cut over -> contract schema evolution with writer fencing, resumable data work and evidence-based recovery/rollback.

All fourteen historical DUR-02 subjects are bindingly reconciled. In particular:

- Character state and FND-04 session/lease persistence semantics are satisfied by accepted Character/FND-04 architecture;
- item/inventory/ground/currency/value semantics and conservation are owned by `GAME-ITEM-01` + `DUR-03`;
- market/economy -> `EXP-ECONOMY-01`;
- guild/social -> `EXP-SOCIAL-01`;
- houses -> `EXP-HOUSES-01`;
- recurring/meta rewards -> `GAME-META-01`;
- encounter/event rewards -> `EXP-EVENTS-01`;
- ANL-01 remains event/audit semantic authority;
- partitioning/sharding and exact Rust DB/migration library remain implementation/PERF choices unless later evidence creates a correctness constraint.

`MOVED` means semantic ownership moved; it does not accept the destination gate or behavior.

## Implementation boundary

Whole-DUR-02 acceptance removes the final generic persistence architecture blocker for already accepted common scopes. A later explicitly authorized server/persistence foundation implementation programme may consume FND-02/FND-03/FND-04/DUR-01/DUR-02/ANL-01/GAME-CHAR without waiting for GAME-ITEM/DUR-03.

The accepted safe decomposition remains:

```text
server bootstrap / GameNode shell
-> protocol-oteryn transport/runtime adapter
-> admission + GameSession + CharacterLease
-> PostgreSQL migration/persistence substrate
-> Character/FND-04 persistence
-> minimal ChannelRuntime
```

No part of that implementation was authorized or executed by this task. Durable item/currency/value mutation remains blocked on GAME-ITEM-01 + DUR-03.

## Delivery validation

### Repair cycle 1

Initial coordination condensation accidentally removed the existing ADR-0014/0015/0016 progressive-policy sentence from the global register. The final delivery restored it exactly, preserving dual-transport architecture-only status, runtime mode unavailability and ADR-0009 one-process GameNode semantics.

Repair budget used: `1/3`.

### Mandatory exact-head self-review

- exact head: `900be9f499981e638a6f8089fb46331b43ba321c`;
- review id: `4914253621`;
- verdict: **PASS**;
- material findings after repair: `0`;
- changed paths: exactly five declared documentation/task paths;
- branch at terminal review: `behind_by=0`;
- unresolved review threads before merge: `0`.

### Mandatory independent exact-head review

- independent reviewer: `chatgpt-codex-connector[bot]`;
- trigger comment: `5263972200`;
- result comment: `5264011166`;
- reviewed commit: `900be9f499` (exact final-head prefix);
- result: **PASS — no major issues**;
- independent material findings: `0`.

### Exact-head CI

For final delivery head `900be9f499981e638a6f8089fb46331b43ba321c`:

- Agent Governance run `31576235871`, generation #907 — **success**;
- Dependency Review run `31576235909`, generation #651 — **success**;
- CodeQL run `31576235921`, generation #795 — **success**.

### Component / integration / runtime E2E

`NOT_APPLICABLE` — paper-only owner architecture acceptance; no executable database/runtime behavior changed.

## Delivery result

- PR #201 final head: `900be9f499981e638a6f8089fb46331b43ba321c`;
- squash merge: `ec4b840b0742967370a4235d87094b29a802fe28`;
- final review threads: `0`;
- owner baseline and coordination overlays are canonical on main;
- no SQL DDL, migration execution, Rust server/persistence code, Platform write or production action occurred.

## Next action

After lifecycle closeout, the generic protocol/runtime/session/common-persistence architecture is ready for an **explicit owner implementation authorization**. Until such authorization is given:

```text
server/persistence foundation implementation = NOT_AUTHORIZED
DUR-02 ImplementationStatus = NOT_STARTED
runtime / DDL authority = NONE
```

Parallel paper-only architecture may continue under separate ownership for GAME-ITEM/DUR-03, GAME-CHANNEL, DUR-04, Reference evidence/parity and SIM-DETERMINISM.

## Lifecycle closeout

- closeout branch: `docs/OTV2-20260812-dur-02-owner-acceptance-closeout`;
- closeout PR: pending;
- closeout scope: complete active -> archive move plus current-status `DUR-02 DeliveryStatus OPEN -> LIFECYCLE_CLOSED` and immutable #201 evidence only;
- owner release: effective after closeout merge;
- semantic changes permitted in closeout: none.
