## Outcome

Delivered the nonbinding whole-gate reconciliation packet:

- `docs/architecture/DUR-02_PERSISTENCE_V1_WHOLE_GATE_RECONCILIATION.md`.

The packet reconciles every historical subject under stable gate `DUR-02 — Persistence v1` against later accepted architecture. It reduces the remaining generic Persistence-v1 architecture decision to six common rules and explicitly moves domain semantics out of the generic persistence gate where later ownership is clearer.

The delivery does **not** accept overall DUR-02 and creates no SQL DDL, migration, Rust persistence runtime, Platform or production authority.

Canonical status remains:

```text
DUR-02 overall
DecisionStatus       = PROPOSED
DeliveryStatus       = PLANNED
ImplementationStatus = NOT_STARTED
Runtime / DDL authority = NONE
```

## Exhaustive historical reconciliation

All fourteen historical DUR-02 subjects were classified with one primary disposition:

1. migration mechanism/schema ownership -> `RETAIN_DUR02`;
2. Character state/revision fencing -> `SATISFIED` by accepted Character persistence + GAME-CHAR;
3. Character lease schema/ownership -> `SATISFIED` by FND-04 + Character persistence;
4. inventory/equipment/ground-item transfer -> `MOVED` to GAME-ITEM-01 + DUR-03;
5. idempotency/duplicate-command foundation -> `SATISFIED` by FND-02 + ANL + Character receipts;
6. isolation/locking/retry -> `RETAIN_DUR02`;
7. transactional outbox/publication checkpoint/dedup/recovery -> `RETAIN_DUR02`;
8. critical audit vs best-effort telemetry -> `SATISFIED` by ANL-01 + Character persistence;
9. atomic item/currency/security evidence semantics -> `MOVED` to the owning authoritative domain + ANL-01, with item/currency conservation in DUR-03;
10. checkpoint interval/max accepted progress loss -> `RETAIN_DUR02` as durable-ack/runtime-checkpoint/disaster-RPO separation rather than guessed numbers;
11. market/guild/house/reward consistency -> `MOVED` to explicit gameplay owners;
12. partitioning -> `IMPLEMENTATION_DEFERRED` to measured PERF/implementation evidence;
13. backup/PITR/restore/RPO/RTO -> `RETAIN_DUR02` for safety capability envelope, numeric objectives downstream;
14. compatible migration rollout/rollback -> `RETAIN_DUR02`.

Exact domain mapping for historical consistency subjects:

- market/economy -> `EXP-ECONOMY-01`;
- guild/social -> `EXP-SOCIAL-01`;
- houses -> `EXP-HOUSES-01`;
- recurring/meta rewards -> `GAME-META-01`;
- encounter/event rewards -> `EXP-EVENTS-01`;
- item/currency conservation for all of those -> `DUR-03`.

A `MOVED` classification did not accept the destination gate; it only removed dual ownership from generic DUR-02.

## Six-rule minimum whole-DUR-02 closure recommendation

The packet recommends owner acceptance of only the following remaining common Persistence-v1 rules:

1. **Migration authority** — one ordered migration history for the current `oteryn_game` database boundary; immutable project-owned explicit migration artifacts; dedicated least-privilege migrator; no production runtime auto-schema-sync; exact Rust migration library deferred.
2. **Transaction correctness** — READ COMMITTED only with explicit anomaly-closing locks/constraints; otherwise bounded SERIALIZABLE or stricter accepted domain mechanism; retries retain the same semantic operation identity.
3. **Common audit/outbox substrate** — one ANL-compatible durable journal + mutable crash-safe publication-state/checkpoint pattern; mandatory evidence commits atomically with owning mutation; best-effort telemetry stays separate.
4. **Progress-loss separation** — acknowledged durable mutation means committed and reconstructible across ordinary process/node restart; FND-03 runtime checkpoint/replay is separate; disaster RPO is separately measured operations/product policy.
5. **PITR/restore safety** — production persistence is PITR-capable and restore-tested, restored authority starts fail-closed, and a newer non-rollback authority fence/equivalent is required before admission resumes; numeric RPO/RTO/cadence remain downstream.
6. **Schema evolution** — common expand -> migrate/backfill -> validate -> cut over -> contract discipline with incompatible-writer fencing, resumable data work, explicit semantic migrations and evidence-based recovery/rollback rather than mandatory naive down migrations.

## Relationship to implementation

If a later owner-acceptance lifecycle accepts the six-rule package, the recommended state is:

```text
DUR-02 — Persistence v1
DecisionStatus       = ACCEPTED
DeliveryStatus       = LIFECYCLE_CLOSED
ImplementationStatus = NOT_STARTED
Runtime authority    = NONE
DDL/migrations       = NOT_AUTHORIZED by architecture acceptance alone
```

That acceptance would allow a **separately authorized** server/persistence foundation implementation programme to begin for already accepted scopes without waiting for GAME-ITEM/DUR-03. Durable item/currency/value mutation remains blocked on GAME-ITEM-01 + DUR-03.

The implementation path may then be decomposed into real executable increments such as:

```text
server bootstrap / GameNode shell
-> protocol-oteryn transport/runtime adapter
-> admission + GameSession + CharacterLease
-> PostgreSQL migration/persistence substrate
-> Character/FND-04 persistence
-> minimal ChannelRuntime
-> later movement/combat/item/content vertical-slice increments
```

This reconciliation itself grants none of that runtime authority.

## Repair history

### Repair cycle 1 — status and future-topology scope

Found:

1. the initial packet described overall DUR-02 `DeliveryStatus=OPEN` during a pre-decision analysis task, although the canonical gate status correctly remained `PLANNED`;
2. the initial migration-ledger rule could be read as prohibiting a future explicitly accepted separate game-domain database/service.

Repaired:

- overall DUR-02 remains `PROPOSED / PLANNED / NOT_STARTED` throughout nonbinding analysis;
- the one-ledger rule is explicitly bounded to the current `oteryn_game` database boundary; a genuinely separate persistence authority requires a future explicit ADR.

### Repair cycle 2 — exact domain ownership and crash-safe publication checkpoint

Found:

1. the historical market/guild/house/reward bucket needed exact destination owners rather than generic `domain owner` wording;
2. at-least-once publication alone did not fully freeze crash-safe publication checkpoint/recovery semantics.

Repaired:

- added exact domain mappings listed above;
- publication claim/checkpoint state is restart-safe, claim is not proof of delivery, publisher crash leaves work retriable/reconcilable, ambiguous broker outcomes retain the same EventId/content and attempted submission cannot delete immutable event evidence.

Repair budget used: `2/3`.

## Delivery validation

### Mandatory exact-head self-review

- exact head: `2311211a5c5ada1a782aee59dfe62587b6c5be99`;
- review id: `4914018453`;
- result: **PASS**;
- material findings after repair cycle 2: `0`;
- final compare: exactly two declared paths, `behind_by=0`;
- unresolved review threads before merge: `0`.

### Exact-head CI

For `2311211a5c5ada1a782aee59dfe62587b6c5be99`:

- Agent Governance `31574108650`, generation #900 — **success**;
- Dependency Review `31574108653`, generation #646 — **success**;
- CodeQL `31574108672`, generation #788 — **success**.

### Component / integration / runtime E2E

`NOT_APPLICABLE` — nonbinding paper-only architecture reconciliation; no executable database/runtime behavior changed.

### Independent review

`NOT_REQUIRED` for this nonbinding packet after terminal self-review found no material uncertainty and the packet grants no binding persistence/recovery/runtime authority. A later owner-acceptance delivery is expected to require an independent exact-head review because it will make high-risk persistence/recovery semantics binding.

## Delivery result

- delivery PR: #199;
- final head: `2311211a5c5ada1a782aee59dfe62587b6c5be99`;
- squash merge: `b37a4071787fb0a3af13608670c44fc07adcc78d`;
- changed files: exactly task + reconciliation packet;
- current status/register/horizon unchanged;
- PR #191 and #162 untouched;
- external repositories untouched;
- no runtime/DDL/migration/production action performed.

## Next action

The next action is an explicit owner decision on the six-rule minimum whole-DUR-02 closure package and the fourteen-subject reconciliation disposition.

Until that decision is accepted through its own owner-baseline lifecycle:

```text
DUR-02 = PROPOSED / PLANNED / NOT_STARTED
runtime / DDL authority = NONE
```

## Lifecycle closeout

- owner release: effective after closeout merge;
- semantic/status changes in closeout: none.
