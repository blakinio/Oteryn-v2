# CrystalServer legacy spatial import readiness — 2026-08-18

## Verdict

**READY_FOR_EXACT_HEAD_REVIEW** for the bounded semantic importer profile.

This evidence does not authorize asset redistribution, Game exporter runtime, Atlas runtime, physical serialization, or production use.

## Evidence findings

### Horizontal axes

The pinned legacy renderer places `(x - min_x) * 32` on the horizontal image axis and `(y - min_y) * 32` on the vertical image axis. This is consistent with the accepted native +X east/right and +Y south/down semantic orientation.

**Result:** identity x/y conversion is evidence-supported for this source family.

### Vertical order

The accepted native profile requires larger `FloorId` values to be geometrically higher/above. The legacy source uses the opposite numerical direction for Z. An affine negation mapping preserves ordering without promoting legacy surface conventions.

Selected mapping:

```text
FloorId = -legacy_z
```

For legacy populated `Z=0..15`, the native valid floor set is `[-15..0]` expressed strictly increasing.

**Result:** legacy Thais `Z=7` maps to native `FloorId=-7`.

### Bounds

Otheryn durable handover records the mandatory historical Thais region:

- `X=32280..32440` inclusive;
- `Y=32155..32305` inclusive;
- `Z=7`.

Native profile rectangles are half-open, therefore the exact mapped selection is:

```text
x=[32280,32441)
y=[32155,32306)
floor=-7
```

This preserves the historical 161 x 151 tile-position rectangle.

### Visible same-position order

Pinned `semantic.py` constructs a tile as:

- optional compact ground;
- remaining compact items;
- top-level child ITEM nodes in preserved source order;
- nested item children retained inside their parent item.

Pinned `render.py` renders optional ground followed by `tile.items` and explicitly states that nested item children are container contents, not visible map stack entries.

**Result:** the importer can preserve the evidenced legacy visible sequence by assigning `PresentationOrderKey { plane: 0, order: sequence_index }` per tile. Atlas consumers receive the explicit native order key and do not infer legacy order themselves.

## Negative boundaries

The evidence does **not** establish:

- canonical stable Game identities for every legacy item ID;
- collision, interaction, targeting, movement or mutation ordering;
- native appearance anchor/footprint/displacement semantics for the Tibia asset set;
- redistribution rights for Tibia/CipSoft assets;
- a permanent physical Game -> Atlas serializer/chunk profile.

Those remain separate gates.

## DYN-ATLAS effect

After merge, DYN-ATLAS-001 may treat the historical Thais rectangle as a reproducible legacy source selection and map it into native coordinates/floor/presentation order through the Game-owned profile.

It still must not:

- parse OTBM in browser runtime;
- infer canonical identities from legacy IDs;
- publish proprietary asset pixels without a separate rights gate;
- claim complete Game -> Atlas compatibility without a bounded Game-owned semantic export fixture/digest and any required appearance profile.

## Classification

- coordinate orientation: **PROVEN**
- Thais legacy bounds: **PROVEN**
- parser-visible top-level sequence: **PROVEN**
- `FloorId=-legacy_z`: **DERIVED DESIGN CHOICE preserving accepted native order**, now proposed as Game-owned importer authority
- presentation plane `0` + order index: **DERIVED DESIGN CHOICE preserving pinned legacy draw order**, now proposed as Game-owned importer authority
- asset redistribution: **UNKNOWN / NOT AUTHORIZED**
- appearance spatial profile: **UNKNOWN**
- Game semantic fixture/export artifact: **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
