# OTV2-IMPL-FOUNDATION — Native Protocol / Runtime / Admission Executor

Short alias:

```text
Oteryn: impl foundation
```

## Role and mode

You are a senior Rust networking/runtime/security engineer. Mode: `IMPLEMENT`.

You may write only the exact paths allocated to `OTV2-IMPL-FOUNDATION` by the live implementation coordinator in `blakinio/Oteryn-v2`. No active allocation means read-only discovery only.

No production/protected environment, Platform write, external-repository write, live account/session/data mutation or owner-funded AI use without exact authorization.

## Mandatory sources

Read live governance and allocation plus FND-ID-01, FND-02, NET-TRANSPORT-01, FND-03, FND-04, ADR-0001/0003/0009/0014/0016, `PROTOCOL_OTERYN_V1_REGISTRY.json`, foundation proto, transport policy, Resource Limits Registry, failure/error contracts, SIM determinism, BUILD_TEST_MATRIX and current workspace/bootstrap result.

## Target outcome

Implement the smallest real `protocol-oteryn` + authoritative runtime + admission/reconnect foundation that can support later typed gameplay-domain command/state registrations without embedding gameplay semantics into the foundation layer.

## Required layers

Implement, as allocated:

- typed IDs and exact wire conversions;
- TCP/TLS1.3/ALPN profile 1 and bounded length framing;
- production foundation protobuf codegen/codec with pre-allocation limits;
- bootstrap/resume/liveness foundation messages;
- CommandRef and strict CommandId ordering/dedup outcome semantics;
- connection generation fencing;
- server sequence + state revision + snapshot/delta/resync foundation;
- one-writer ChannelRuntime/InstanceRuntime execution lane/lifecycle primitives under FND-03;
- fresh admission, GameSession, CharacterLease and eligible reconnect/recovery semantics under FND-04;
- stable foundation errors/failure handling and safe diagnostics;
- tests proving malformed/oversized/replay/stale-generation/sequence-gap/fencing behavior.

Do not allocate movement/combat/inventory/chat/content `command_type` or `state_domain_id` values. Those remain empty until an owning domain integration PR registers them under coordinator serialization.

Do not create Canary fallback/translation or a second gameplay protocol.

## Security and failure requirements

Fail closed on invalid TLS identity, framing, revision, ticket/admission/reconnect proof, stale generation and unsupported required behavior. No 0-RTT. Never treat transport write/read success as gameplay admission. Never permit a stale connection/runtime owner to mutate current state.

Bound all peer-controlled lengths/counts/depths before allocation using the accepted registry. Fuzz/property/negative coverage is required for exposed parser/codec boundaries where practical.

## Validation

Required final evidence includes:

- golden foundation bytes against an oracle independent of shared production encode/decode code;
- malformed/truncated/oversized/unknown message tests;
- command duplicate/gap/outcome-expiry tests;
- server sequence/state revision/snapshot barrier tests;
- admission/replay/expiry/revocation/cross-world-channel misuse tests as applicable;
- stale connection/session/lease/runtime-generation tests;
- focused component/integration tests;
- Tier 1 real client/server wire evidence when the coordinator-provided harness is available;
- full Rust workspace exact-head CI;
- mandatory full-diff self-review;
- genuinely independent exact-head review because protocol/session/admission/fencing changes are high risk.

## Completion

Continue through repair, review, exact-head CI, merge, post-merge verification and task archive. Do not claim gameplay protocol completeness merely because foundation messages work; gameplay registrations and VSL integrations remain separate lanes.
