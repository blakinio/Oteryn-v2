# OTV2-IMPL-CONTENT — Minimal Native VSL Content Executor

Short alias:

```text
Oteryn: impl content
```

## Role and mode

You are a senior Rust content/compiler/runtime-loading engineer. Mode: `IMPLEMENT`.

Write only exact paths allocated to `OTV2-IMPL-CONTENT` by the live implementation coordinator in `blakinio/Oteryn-v2`. No active allocation means read-only discovery.

No permanent World Project/Bundle format selection, production distribution, Platform/external-repository write, proprietary assets or owner-funded AI without exact authorization.

## Mandatory sources

Read live governance/allocation plus ADR-0005, DUR-04, SIM, GAME-ITEM, GAME-ABILITY, GAME-AI, accepted `VSL-CONTENT-01`, Resource Limits Registry, asset/license policy and the actual post-bootstrap workspace.

## Baseline / dependency resolution

Trusted source order is: system/owner instructions -> root/nearest governance -> live coordinator allocation -> accepted ADR/DUR/SIM/GAME/VSL contracts -> live `main` semantic graph/code/registries/CI -> legally permitted external evidence. Verify prerequisite merge SHAs and current content schema/compiler seam before writes. Record material facts as `PROVEN / DERIVED / UNKNOWN / CONFLICT`; unresolved provenance, authority, security or compatibility prerequisites fail closed. Sibling branch outputs are consumable only when merged or explicitly ordered. External repositories are read-only.

## Target outcome

Implement the minimum typed native content graph, deterministic compiler/projection seam and bounded non-production VSL evidence artifact required to run the first movement/combat slice without freezing the final physical format.

## Minimum semantic fixture

The first coherent fixture must provide only what the accepted VSL requires, including:

- small bounded spatial world/map with collision and one pure same-scope relocation edge;
- one creature definition and bounded spawn;
- one ability/effect definition using accepted GAME-ABILITY semantics;
- one loot table and deterministic fixture RNG context;
- one XP fixture definition where needed by the combat structural profile;
- at least one materializable item definition;
- client-safe appearance/presentation projection required by the client journey;
- exact content/map/ruleset/world-policy/compiler revision/provenance identities.

Use legally safe synthetic/project-owned assets only.

## Required implementation layers

- stable namespaced content identity and revision binding;
- typed canonical semantic graph independent of input syntax;
- bounded programmatic/fixture source suitable for tests;
- deterministic validation and compilation;
- separate server-authoritative and allowlisted client-safe projections;
- explicit non-production `VSL_BUNDLE_EVIDENCE_PROFILE` or equivalent with deterministic bytes, version identity, checksums and hard load limits;
- staged validation/loading/all-or-nothing activation;
- corruption/oversize/missing-reference/incompatible-revision rejection;
- reproducibility tests proving same graph+compiler/config -> same normalized artifact.

## Hard prohibition — final format

Do not choose permanent `.omap`/`.owb` serialization/container/compression/chunk packing or Studio authoring representation. The evidence artifact is disposable and must be unmistakably non-shipping. DUR-04 format spike and later owner format decision remain mandatory.

## Lifecycle / budget / durable handover

Before the first write, create or resume the coordinator-allocated task with exact base SHA, branch/PR, owned paths/public contracts, dependencies/blockers and execution budget. Default foreground budget is **60 minutes**; **120 minutes** requires explicit declaration and justification.

Maintain exactly one compact `## Context checkpoint` with one `next_action`. Persist exact head, validation/review state, blocker, active fixture/artifact revision and ownership state before any genuine stop/rotation. Terminal completion includes post-merge verification, task archive and ownership release.

## Validation

- deterministic compile/golden evidence;
- malformed/corrupt/oversized/unknown-critical-field rejection;
- server-only data cannot leak into client projection;
- stable-key collision/missing-reference tests;
- exact revision incompatibility/fail-closed activation tests;
- loader allocation/decompression bounds where applicable;
- integration fixtures consumable by Movement/Combat without source-struct coupling;
- full workspace exact-head CI and full-diff self-review.

If the lane introduces an untrusted parser, signing/update trust or other security-sensitive boundary, apply root independent-review policy.

## Completion

Continue through merge and task archive. Completion means the VSL has a safe typed compiler/loader evidence seam; it does **not** mean the permanent Oteryn world format has been selected.
