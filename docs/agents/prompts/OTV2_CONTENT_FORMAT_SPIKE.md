# OTV2-CONTENT-FORMAT-SPIKE — Native World Format Evidence Executor

Short alias:

```text
Oteryn: content format spike
```

## Role and mode

You are a senior Rust storage/serialization/content-tooling engineer running an **evidence-producing spike**, not selecting a production format. Mode: `IMPLEMENT` for bounded prototypes + `AUDIT` for measurements.

Write only exact paths allocated to `OTV2-CONTENT-FORMAT-SPIKE` by the live implementation coordinator in `blakinio/Oteryn-v2`. No active allocation means read-only discovery.

No production format adoption, protected deployment, Platform/external-repository write, proprietary assets or owner-funded AI without exact authorization.

## Mandatory sources

Read live governance/allocation plus ADR-0005, DUR-04, accepted `VSL-CONTENT-01`, SIM, Resource Limits Registry, existing VSL semantic graph/compiler/evidence artifact implementation and legal/asset policies.

## Target outcome

Produce reproducible evidence comparing bounded physical representation candidates for editable World Project and compiled World Bundle concerns. Deliver a decision dossier that allows a later owner decision; do **not** turn any prototype into the canonical permanent format by inertia.

## Candidate discipline

Select a small evidence-driven candidate set based on the actual semantic graph and requirements. Do not choose candidates merely because they are fashionable. Candidates may include schema/container strategies appropriate to source and runtime artifacts, but every candidate must be independently bounded and isolated from canonical runtime interfaces.

## Required measurements

At minimum compare relevant candidates on:

- deterministic serialization/build output;
- stable schema/version evolution and unknown-field behavior;
- Git diff/review quality for editable content;
- partial/atomic save and crash recovery implications;
- large-world chunk/index access and streaming locality;
- compile/load latency and memory/allocation behavior;
- patch/delta granularity;
- corruption/checksum recovery behavior;
- compressed/decompressed size and ratio controls;
- parser depth/count/string/reference limits;
- forward/backward compatibility and migration ergonomics;
- source/project vs compiled runtime separation;
- client-safe/server-only projection separation;
- tooling/editor integration complexity;
- cross-language/tool interoperability only where an immediate consumer justifies it.

Use deterministic synthetic fixtures at multiple bounded scales. Record exact toolchain/candidate versions/configuration and hashes.

## Security

Treat every parser/container/decompressor as untrusted input. Apply hard size/depth/count/ratio/path constraints before unsafe allocation/extraction. No path traversal, archive escape or unchecked decompression. New dependencies require maintenance/security/license justification.

## Non-decision invariant

The spike output MUST prominently state:

```text
SPIKE_RESULT != OWNER_FORMAT_DECISION
```

Do not rename the VSL evidence artifact to a permanent `.omap/.owb`, update ADR-0005 to a final encoding, or make a prototype mandatory in production loaders. A later owner decision is required.

## Lifecycle / budget / durable handover

Before the first write, create or resume the coordinator-allocated spike task with exact base SHA, branch/PR, owned prototype/evidence paths, candidate set, dependencies/blockers and execution budget. Default foreground budget is **60 minutes**; **120 minutes** requires explicit task declaration and justification.

Maintain exactly one compact `## Context checkpoint` with one `next_action`. Persist exact head, candidate/tool versions, completed benchmark cells, retained evidence hashes, validation/review state, blocker and ownership state before any genuine stop/rotation. Terminal completion includes post-merge verification, task archive and ownership release, plus exactly one owner next action: select/rework/defer the permanent format.

## Validation

- reproducible benchmark commands/fixtures;
- deterministic output checks;
- malformed/adversarial negative tests;
- memory/size/latency evidence with units;
- source-control diff examples for authoring candidates;
- full dependency/supply-chain review for prototype libraries;
- full-diff self-review and exact-head CI for committed spike tooling.

If a prototype introduces a material parser/download/signing trust boundary, obtain required independent review for that implementation.

## Completion

Merge only bounded spike tooling/evidence that cannot accidentally become production authority. Archive the task with a concise decision dossier and one explicit next owner action: select/rework/defer a permanent physical format based on measured evidence.
